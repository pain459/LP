Experiments and Enhancements

    Message Delivery Semantics
        At-Least-Once Delivery: Ensure messages are processed at least once by setting appropriate consumer configuration.
        At-Most-Once Delivery: Configure the consumer to avoid message reprocessing.
        Exactly-Once Delivery: Implement exactly-once semantics using Kafka transactions.

    Performance Testing
        Throughput Testing: Measure the maximum throughput by increasing the message production rate.
        Latency Measurement: Measure end-to-end latency from message production to consumption.
        Load Testing: Test the system's performance under high load conditions.

    Scaling Kafka
        Scale Consumers: Add more consumer instances to see how it impacts the processing speed.
        Scale Producers: Add more producer instances to test Kafkaâ€™s capacity.
        Add Kafka Brokers: Scale the Kafka cluster horizontally by adding more brokers.

    Fault Tolerance and High Availability
        Broker Failure: Simulate broker failures and observe how the system handles it.
        Consumer/Producer Failure: Simulate consumer and producer failures to test recovery mechanisms.
        Zookeeper Failure: Simulate Zookeeper node failures and observe the impact on Kafka.

    Topic Partitioning and Replication
        Increase Partitions: Increase the number of partitions for a topic to improve parallelism.
        Replication Factor: Experiment with different replication factors for fault tolerance.

    Security Enhancements
        Authentication: Implement SASL/SSL for secure communication between Kafka clients and brokers.
        Authorization: Set up ACLs to control access to topics.

    Data Retention and Log Compaction
        Retention Policies: Experiment with different retention policies for topics.
        Log Compaction: Enable log compaction for topics to retain the latest state of a key.

    Monitoring and Alerting
        Metrics Collection: Set up Kafka monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
        Logging: Enhance logging for better observability.
        Alerting: Configure alerts for key metrics like broker availability, consumer lag, etc.

    Schema Management
        Schema Registry: Use Confluent Schema Registry to manage message schemas.
        Schema Evolution: Experiment with schema evolution and compatibility checks.

    Stream Processing
        Kafka Streams: Implement stream processing using Kafka Streams API.
        KSQL: Use KSQL for stream processing with SQL-like queries.
        Integration with Apache Flink: Integrate Kafka with Flink for advanced stream processing capabilities.
