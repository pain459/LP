1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You don't want to do this.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Step out of the car.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's go first.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What's the code man?

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Good.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Five points.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A white, a round, but I'm not always around.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A tennis ball.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A tennis ball's a yellow.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I know a light bulb.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No.

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
A pizza.

307
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you.

308
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Is this table?

309
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yes, it's still.

335
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And in other news, the drug enforcement ministers of six Latin American countries arrived in Miami today for a summit meeting

336
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in Jefferson building.

337
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Come on, Frank.

338
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
1156 Palmetto, waiting for an express delivery.

339
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's what you told me 45 minutes ago.

340
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Come on, I don't need anything else.

341
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Just give me the pizza.

342
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm not paying for that.

343
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hi.

345
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So, Mr. Martin, this one meeting time, no mozzarella, extra olives, and extra anchovies, which amounts to 1195.

346
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I hope you're hungry.

347
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You have no idea.

348
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I apologize for the delay, sir.

349
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What's the noise?

350
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Uh-huh.

351
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I drink.

352
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What are you doing?

353
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What does it look like I'm doing?

354
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We've been drinking.

383
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Who isn't?

384
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Thank you, Frank.

385
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
For the time.

387
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I think it's what I needed the most.

426
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Dr. Koblin, if you come out here, please, we have an issue.

427
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You'll have to fill out some papers dating the medical problem.

428
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Actually, my problem is not medical.

429
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's psychological.

430
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes, Laura.

431
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What seems to be the problem?

432
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Me.

433
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Hating shots.

434
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Number one.

435
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There's no guarantee you're getting a shot.

436
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So there's no sense in getting all worked up with something that might not happen.

437
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Give me the good news.

438
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Dr. Sodom cured.

439
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Frank, it hurts a lot.

440
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll never let anyone hurt you a lot.

441
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Promise?

442
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You know my fourth rule.

443
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Never make a promise you can't keep.

444
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Come on.

445
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Close the door.

446
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Eh.

448
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
May I help you?

449
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Chef Billings to see Dr. Koblin.

450
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm sorry. He's out sick today.

451
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He'll be seeing Dr. Tyberg.

452
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I like Dr. Koblin.

453
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Don't worry. Dr. Tyberg's very nice.

454
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Now, if you'll just take him into room three.

455
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Where's Miss Laura?

456
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Who?

457
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You're standing at her desk.

458
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That Miss Laura.

459
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
She's out sick, too.

460
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
There's a lot of flu going around.

461
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Now, come on. Dr. Scott, a busy day.

463
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Never be over before you know it.

464
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hey!

465
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm Dr. Tyberg.

466
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Can't I wait for my doctor?

467
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Unfortunately, your doctor was called away on emergency.

468
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You're not sure he had the flu.

469
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That was the emergency.

470
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He came down with flu very quickly.

471
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish.

472
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Come, I show you something very cool.

473
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sorry, Dr. Patient Privacy in the room,

474
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
but you can't wait in reception area or glass of water or...

475
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Hey, trust me.

476
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And, Dr., please, it's fun.

477
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah.

478
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Hello?

479
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Frank?

480
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm here.

481
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You're early.

483
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
We had fantastic television.

484
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
A few hours in my vacation, just like that.

485
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
From now on, it's the only way I'll flag, Frank.

486
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Tell the winds on nothing.

487
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Glad you made it.

489
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Sorry, Dr. Dunias is not in today. Call back my day.

490
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's an inspector. I'm a little tied up.

491
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You mind taking a cab? You have the address, yes?

492
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, thank you.

493
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh, you know, I heard that if he's down to here, it's fantastic.

494
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I could fake us a bouillet bus.

495
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You're like, we're your best, Frank, now.

496
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I gotta go.

497
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Frank!

498
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You know, maybe it's better if you wait for his regular talk to the comeback.

499
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's very important that he receives immunizations.

500
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Well, I'm sure it is.

501
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But a week won't make a difference.

502
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
No, what are you doing?

503
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
No!

505
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Get going, Jack!

508
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

509
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Remember my promise?

510
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes.

511
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's me!

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Get out!

514
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Shit!

515
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The patient's not cooperating.

516
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Cut the vehicle.

517
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Come on, hurry.

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay.

520
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Freeze!

521
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Drop your weapon!

522
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Get down!

523
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Put your guns on the ground!

524
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
See?

525
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Take out a way.

526
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Cut!

527
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Plan B?

528
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yes, Plan B.

529
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, he made it.

530
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Huh?

531
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What's that?

532
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Jack's birthday present.

533
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
baseball uniform, cleats, glove, and a bat.

534
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's his favorite sport.

535
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It was last year.

536
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He's on a soccer team now, and he's actually really good.

537
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You know, you should see him sometimes.

542
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You know, you should see him sometime.

544
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Mr. and Mrs. Billings, they're coming!

545
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Hi, everyone!

547
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Good morning, Mr. Driver.

548
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Who is this?

549
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Look in your rear view mirror, and you see a wheelies.

550
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I know what you're thinking.

551
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Pull a proof glass.

552
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So now you tell me your experience

553
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
which judging from the little performance you put on back

554
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
at the office because way beyond just driving children

555
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
to school and back, does?

556
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll pull a proof glass top of 7.6 to armor, busy ground.

557
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Great.

558
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Why'd you stop the car?

559
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Don't bother Louis, I try, I agree.

560
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
They're over 300 feet away.

561
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Come on, Frank, pick up.

562
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
None of this would have been necessary if you had not screwed up my life.

563
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So now I'm going to tell you how to set things right.

564
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Someone is going to appear in a few seconds.

565
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Let her in.

566
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Driver.

567
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Good boy, good boy.

569
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Leave it on.

570
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Personally, I hate kids.

571
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't know what your feelings are on the subject,

572
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
but if you ever want to have any, make no moves,

573
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
but the move I tell you to make.

574
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You're in her hands now, have you come here?

575
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
They can be very gentle hands.

576
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But they can be the hands from hell. Trust me on this one.

577
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Trust him on this one.

578
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You're a drive.

579
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Make a laugh.

580
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I said laugh.

581
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Listen, keep doing this your way, no matter how many rides

582
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
it lets you make, they're going to catch us.

583
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Let me do this by way, so no one gets hurt.

584
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Where's the runnin' hat?

585
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Let's save the fun for later.

586
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Let's save the fun.

590
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Not bad.

591
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Did your mother ever teach you to say thank you?

592
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah, she tried and failed miserably.

593
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I think we lost them.

594
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Think again.

595
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's not complete.

596
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Let's go.

597
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What do you mean you can't find him?

598
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
He's one man in one car.

599
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
He's a chauffeur for Christ's sake.

600
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Not exactly, sir.

601
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You think there's a possibility he may have been in on it?

602
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's impossible.

603
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
How would you know?

604
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He's been workin' here for a month.

605
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
He could have been settin' us up the whole time

606
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and you wouldn't own any different.

607
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You are such an expert on knowing people.

608
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
His back around.

609
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
He's got special forces.

610
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
He's got a special forces.

661
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You're quite a guy.

662
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Another time.

663
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Another place.

664
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You and me, maybe.

665
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The pleasure we get out.

666
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Beauty.

667
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Frank.

670
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That's what we expected when you reported for work this morning.

671
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Is it Frank?

673
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Is that what passes with witness, sir?

674
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
This is my friend.

675
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
With?

676
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's not a requirement of the job.

677
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Brutality.

679
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
An ability to inflict pain.

680
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Absolutely.

681
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Certain psychotic moral ignorance.

682
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Blind obedience.

683
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Or required.

684
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But not with.

685
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
How was it?

686
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Fine.

687
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
A little beginning in my life.

688
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
What's this all about?

689
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
A timely question.

690
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Max?

691
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Pardon me.

692
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Hello.

693
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Put me on the speaker so you don't have to repeat instructions.

694
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
In the next two hours, you get $5 million in non-sequential $100 bills.

695
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You put them in a waterproof suitcase.

696
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You go to the bayfront park.

697
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Personally.

698
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
There will be a blue Chrysler parked on the sand.

699
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You place the suitcase in the trunk.

700
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I do.

701
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I don't know if I can get $5 million in two hours.

702
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Mr. Billings, please.

703
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I read the newspapers.

704
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The day you were appointed to your current position,

705
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
your network exceeded $100 million.

706
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So you won't even feel the bite.

707
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What?

708
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Guaranteed or I have?

709
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That you won't harm my son.

710
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Guaranteed, Mr. Billings.

711
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm not a car dealer.

712
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Don't let the charming accent and my grammatically impeccable syntax misled you.

713
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I live in the jungle and in the jungle.

714
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You either eat or be eaten.

715
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But in the spirit of doing business, here is the guarantee.

716
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
10 minutes past the deadline.

717
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
If the money doesn't arrive, I'd send a finger.

718
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
20 minutes.

719
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Ah-ha.

721
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
A foot.

722
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Sounds like we have a deal.

723
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Don't we, Mr. Billings?

724
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You have a deal.

725
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Could we please speak to our son?

726
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Mommy!

728
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You have two hours, Mr. Billings.

729
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's starting now.

730
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You're my son.

731
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
All right.

733
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Frank, you promised you wouldn't marry me.

734
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You promised.

735
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Never make promises.

736
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You can't keep my friend.

737
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I don't.

738
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's one of my rules.

739
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Wow.

740
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Bravo.

741
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
A man who leaves his life by the rules.

742
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But in my word, rules are meant to be broken.

743
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Not mine.

744
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
This time we're going to have to make an exception.

745
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Go.

747
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Hey, driver.

748
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No, no, wait, wait.

749
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
A little distance between us isn't a bad thing.

751
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Now.

754
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's me.

755
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
We got them here, gentlemen.

756
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You son of a bitch.

757
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Look, I had nothing to do with this.

758
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
What? scratch on his head.

759
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
One hair out of place.

760
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Mr. Billings, let me speak to you.

761
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Hello, Frank.

762
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
This is you as much as David.

763
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You have to act fast.

764
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
There are three boats.

765
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Crankies.

766
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Just tell us where you are.

767
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Get a plane up over the into coastal.

768
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Just tell me where you are, Frank.

771
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Got it.

773
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Tell Coney it's me.

774
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Get out of the house.

775
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I know.

776
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I were just pressing the metal.

777
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Tell Coney.

778
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Forget the metal ends.

779
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Just get out.

780
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And go where?

781
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Anywhere.

782
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The beach. Go to the beach.

783
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Oh, the beach.

784
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
For the famous Miami Beach.

785
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh, my dream.

786
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I would love to go to the beach.

787
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Maybe not.

789
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
How the fuck are you?

790
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm the cook.

791
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Oh, it's a mistake.

792
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's a terrible mistake.

793
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Why?

794
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We can't.

795
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Oh, just get on.

798
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's Frank.

799
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Don't hang up.

800
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Pretend it's someone else.

801
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Hi, Susan.

802
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Uh, no, I'm just here at home.

803
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I didn't do it, Audrey.

804
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
She had a gun on Jacka.

805
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I had no choice.

807
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I saw that.

808
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
What do you know?

809
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's more than a kidnapping.

810
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
They called and asked for a ransom.

811
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The doctors, they will think.

812
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
They were trying to give Jack a shot.

813
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
When they interrupted them.

814
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Audrey, I promise Jacka wouldn't let anyone hurt him.

815
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm not going to break that promise.

816
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'll call you back.

817
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Audrey.

818
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Is everything all right?

819
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's a pretty stupid question to ask right now.

820
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Don't you think, Jeff?

822
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So tell me again, Inspector Tarkone,

823
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
why you didn't immediately identify yourself as a police officer?

824
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Well, I was overwhelmed by the effectiveness of your preparation.

825
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's the sophistication of your recruitment.

826
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You know, I work in a small office in a small town.

827
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
We only have small crimes.

828
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I must admit, I was a little insecure.

829
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And you and Frank Martin are friends, right?

830
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
A friend.

831
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I wouldn't say exactly a friend.

832
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I know him.

833
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
We have a relationship.

834
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
A long relationship.

835
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Not so long.

836
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But they found you cooking at his house.

837
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'm French.

838
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So?

839
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We don't need to know someone for a long time in order to cook for them.

840
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It's our way of breaking the ice.

841
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Take, for example, you, this sandwich and coffee.

842
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So grossly or for me.

843
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You will put on me to sing so better.

844
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's not very good.

845
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah, no, it sucks.

846
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
What's that got to do with anything?

847
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Do you have a kitchen?

849
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
There you go.

850
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Don't move.

851
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Smith.

852
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Drop it.

853
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh!

876
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Are you sure this is safe?

877
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Look over here, shoulder.

878
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
We got you covered.

879
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
As my mother used to say,

880
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
a meal is only limited by your imagination.

881
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Hmm.

882
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's Cambodian?

883
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's cognizant.

884
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Creme brulee.

885
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Cambodian?

886
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Caught?

887
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Cognizant.

889
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Where are you?

890
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Cooking.

892
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Can you talk?

893
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh.

894
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Speak out a little bit with my mother.

895
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Mom.

896
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Please.

897
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Do you mind?

899
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Very good.

907
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
May I ask you your cooking for?

908
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
For the US Marshals.

909
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Once they found my badge,

910
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
they were very polite to give me a coffee in a sandwich.

911
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You wouldn't believe what passes for food in this place, Frank.

912
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But I'm correcting the situation.

913
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
While they wait for my shift to call back and confirm everything.

914
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Of course.

915
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
That might take a while.

916
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
He's never there.

917
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Anything about me?

919
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
They are very interested about you.

920
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
They want to know where you are.

922
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
No, if I'm very long.

923
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Listen, hold on.

924
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Do you have access to a computer?

926
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Is yours in having access to something decent to it?

932
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Handsome fellow.

933
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Who is it?

934
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That's what I need to know.

935
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Do they have an IT program?

936
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You'll forgive me, bit.

937
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm not so used to this system.

938
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Back home, there is one computer for ten of us.

939
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So.

940
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
How is it with you, Frank?

941
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
It's a complicated story.

942
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You mean your arms are shit?

943
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You might say that.

944
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
In other words, you're not of a state.

945
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Ah.

946
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Well, a Russian biologist with advanced degrees

947
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
from the state laboratory for biological warfare in Siberia.

948
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You have an address?

949
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Miami, Park West, King Street, number 11.

950
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I have an address.

1090
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Okay.

1091
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Tell me about the doctor's office.

1092
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
What doctor's office?

1093
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The one where you try to stick the kid with this.

1096
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Want to tell me?

1118
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
What's left of it?

1172
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
He spoke to Frank Martin.

1173
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
He didn't tell us about it.

1174
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
How are you doing talking to him?

1175
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Because he's the last person who shot Jack alive.

1176
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
We found the boy.

1177
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's shut down.

1178
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Hard drive, Lou.

1179
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We'll give him another one of that.

1180
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yes, sir.

1181
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
How long is it going to take?

1182
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm going as fast as I can.

1183
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
He can suffocate in there.

1184
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Stay calm.

1185
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It's my son.

1186
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I've been letting work.

1187
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Are you just going to sit there and do nothing?

1387
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
What was that?

1388
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I don't know.

1389
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
What was that? I don't know.

1436
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
That's not.

1437
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
What are you?

1438
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Right.

1439
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
There is enough for two of us.

1440
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
You don't need it.

1441
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
But you injected me.

1442
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
With water.

1443
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm not sick.

1444
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Not sick.

1445
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Water.

1447
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You son of a bitch!

1449
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
A problem is solved.

1450
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
One does for each of us.

1451
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
It's not for us.

1453
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
One for you.

1454
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
One for the child.

1455
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Your devotion is touching.

1456
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
My patience is about to run out.

1457
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Ah!

1458
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I'm scared.

1460
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Tell me about the virus.

1462
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
What you must know.

1463
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Everything.

1464
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
The starters.

1465
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
What is it?

1466
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
It's a recombinant retro immune,

1467
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
double polymorphine effluent.

1468
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
The child will die.

1469
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Anyone he breathes on will die.

1470
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And then it's over.

1471
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You mean it's over.

1472
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You know this is designed to go in there after 24 hours.

1473
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Thanks for the lesson.

1474
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Now give me the files.

1475
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You really want to play superhero, don't you?

1476
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Well, let's see if you can fly.

1478
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
You okay?

1480
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
There's nothing to worry about.

1481
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
It's just a simple viral infection,

1482
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
combined with the stress of what happened.

1483
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It should pass in a day or two.

1484
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I gave him something to help him sleep.

1485
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Call me if anything arises.

1487
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Thank you, doctor.

1496
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
You know, Audrey.

1497
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
All this is...

1498
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Well, it's made me realize what a fool I've been.

1499
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
The Jack.

1500
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And with you.

1501
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Are you okay?

1502
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Mr. Villains, we're running late.

1503
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
We'll be right out.

1504
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I'd like to come by after the conference.

1505
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Check on Jack.

1506
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Check on you.

1508
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I'll see you soon.

1509
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
They're here if you need them.

1510
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Are you all right, ma'am?

1511
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I'm fine.

1514
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
You're okay, Mrs. Villain.

1515
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I'll see you a bit, Drone.

1517
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
How are you?

1518
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I'm alone.

1519
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
How are you, Frank?

1521
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Frank, you were wrong.

1522
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
It was a kidnapping.

1523
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Jack is fine.

1524
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Jack's been infected with a deadly virus, Audrey.

1525
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Now, anyone who comes into contact with him will die.

1526
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
What are you telling me?

1527
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Are you telling me that my son is going to die?

1528
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
No, he's not.

1529
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I want to think you better, the virus becomes airborne.

1530
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So, when you want to freeze on, it gets infected.

1531
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Some was a weapon.

1532
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
The target is his father.

1533
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Jefferson?

1534
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Oh, why?

1535
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Because of the conference.

1536
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It's the only logical answer.

1537
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
A drug enforcement agency in the hemisphere in one room.

1538
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
The husband breathes the room dies.

1540
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You're going to trust me, Audrey.

1541
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Can you get to him?

1542
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
What are you going to do?

1543
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I'm the guy responsible.

1544
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
There's more of this.

1545
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
For you and everybody else.

1546
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
For you now.

1547
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
We have a guest.

1548
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
They're burning up.

1550
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You got to go. Go.

1551
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Don't move!

1553
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Is the government here?

1554
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Everybody's going to be here.

1555
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The government delegates from all over the world.

1556
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
It's just that.

1558
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You can't go to the conference.

1560
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
To give him a deadly vibe.

1561
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Audrey, I can't hear you.

1562
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm inside.

1563
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Now I've got it, and so do you.

1565
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Their plan is to infect everyone at the conference.

1566
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm going to have to call you back.

1567
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Jeff.

1568
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
You spill it.

1569
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You all right?

1570
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I'm all right.

1571
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Come on, let's get to work.

1573
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You still a guest of the government?

1575
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I'm the first accommodation.

1576
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Let's make a guest.

1577
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
You need my help.

1578
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You need the computer.

1579
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's practically my pillow.

1581
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I don't want to stop.

1582
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I don't know. I have nothing.

1583
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
My favorite type of investigation.

1584
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Let's see.

1586
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to my delegate.

1587
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Breathe. That's right. Breathe, my friend. Breathe.

1588
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Tomorrow?

1589
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Miss, these bastards are out of the way,

1590
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
and their cooperation agreements are dead in buried.

1591
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
You know what your biggest problem is going to be?

1593
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Counting the money.

1594
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Can't wait for tomorrow.

1595
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1596
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It's easy, isn't it?

1597
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Johnny Chalendy.

1598
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
He hired some self-help 20-win looking to make trouble,

1599
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
like the repurgates and that.

1600
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Someone access the database on the 15th floor.

1601
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
That's Gonzalez. He's on vacation.

1602
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Well, it was behind the host,

1603
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
that's taking up the public ministers in Geneva.

1604
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It was a nice piece of work.

1605
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Give me an address.

1606
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Miami is Thailand, but it can drive number 26,000.

1607
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
We found the car.

1608
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
The one great cop took all of it.

1609
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Thank you for the compliment.

1610
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Now, I'm great back to sleep.

1612
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Oh, my God, man!

1613
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Before the witch!

1614
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It's over.

1615
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I'll do it.

1616
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Stop!

1617
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Set this down, my father, my wife.

1618
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Now you come here.

1619
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I want to know the truth.

1620
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I want to know the truth about you.

1621
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Mommy.

1622
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
You're feeling better?

1623
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
A little bit.

1624
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I'm just trying to go back to sleep, okay?

1625
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Man, are you all right?

1626
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Whoa!

1627
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Jackson!

1628
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Jackson, open!

1629
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Okay, do it.

1631
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
You know, last night got me thinking.

1632
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
How do you transport the antidote safely?

1633
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
We need something that won't break.

1634
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Something that can't be stolen.

1635
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Something totally secure.

1637
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Impressive.

1638
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Get dressed.

1639
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Stop it.

1640
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Is he your friend?

1641
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Not yet.

1642
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Where'd they go?

1643
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
The garage.

1644
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Ah, I'm out of ammo.

1645
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Me too.

1646
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
So am I.

1647
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Where are the reloads?

1649
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Check this!

1650
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Go, go, go!

1651
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Go, go, go, go!

1653
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Go!

1691
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
What do you want me to do?

1692
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Keep the made of running.

1694
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Don't worry, baby.

1695
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
You're safe now.

1696
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
You're safe.

1697
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
You're so beautiful.

1698
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Remind me of my yellow poop rider.

1771
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Oh, Mr. Driver.

1772
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Where are you into tomorrow?

1773
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
But then I bleep what you came for all over the floor.

1774
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
He wouldn't want this for you.

1775
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Not after you walked so hard tried to get to the antidote.

1776
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Take a good look, Frank Martin.

1777
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I'm a cure for what aids you.

1778
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm the only cure for what aids you.

1779
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I am the antidote.

1780
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
When I was dry, I'm impressed.

1781
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Didn't give you enough credit to come to the driver to figure this out.

1782
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I'm figured it all out yet.

1783
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Perhaps I can help you.

1784
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
What part are you a little?

1785
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
How you say?

1786
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Thick.

1788
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
You.

1791
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
That's the easy part.

1792
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
It's a business deal.

1793
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Pure and simple.

1794
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I'm far higher to the highest bidder.

1795
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And in this case, the highest bidder

1796
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
was the Colombian cocaine cartels that wanted this

1797
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
pesky loam and afterpacks.

1798
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You really think killing all these politicians

1799
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
is going to make things easier for them?

1800
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
That's not my problem.

1801
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I was hard to do a job.

1802
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I did the job.

1803
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Like you.

1804
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Just to me.

1805
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
My pay is better.

1806
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
My hair and my suit too.

1807
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Oh, Lola.

1808
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a plan to catch you.

1809
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I'll kill him.

1810
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Chao Chao.

1811
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Don't complain.

1812
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
We'll send this for you.

1813
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Pleasure.

1814
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I'm killing you.

2322
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I'm listening.
