1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I'm so sorry. Can you help me? My tire.

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Sorry I have an appointment. I don't let it be late.

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Well, would you rather be late? Or dead.

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 You don't want to do this.

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Step out of the car.

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Woo! Let's go first! Come on, man!

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Yeah!

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Think it easy. The car's brand new.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 No problem, buddy. I've got this.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Baby, that's right.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Baby, baby, I can show you.

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 The parents know the kind of company you're keeping.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Shut up.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Stop!

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 It's a shame working, man. It's coded.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 What's the code, man?

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm afraid I can't get it down.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Well, I'm afraid we'll have to beat it out.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Let's go get out of this car.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Get out of the car, baby.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 What you got?

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Hold on.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 This came out of the dry cleaners.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Hands up! Stop moving, man. I will shoot you.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 What do you have home, what to do?

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Why don't you go and do it?

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Okay, I'm sorry.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I liked it.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I'm sorry.

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I'm sorry.

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Hey, hey.

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 The game, the game, the game, the game.

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 What's the first rule one entering a man's car?

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Respect the man's car, and then respect you.

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Rule number two.

36
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Greet the man. Good afternoon, Frank.

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Good afternoon, Jack.

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Can we play the game now?

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I think your brain will be too tired after a whole day of school.

40
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 You're just afraid I'm going to win.

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I'm going to win.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 I'm going to win.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I'm going to win.

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I'm going to win.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I'm going to win.

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I'm going to win.

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I'm going to win.

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 You're just afraid I'm going to win.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I'm afraid you're going to be too one not to do your homework.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It's Friday, I don't have any homework.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 In that case, the game.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Yes.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 But first, it's the third rule of the car.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Good.

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Five points.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 A white, a round, but I'm not always around.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 A tennis ball.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 A tennis ball's a yellow.

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Four points.

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Sometimes I'm habs, sometimes I'm whole, sometimes I'm slice of me as all you'll know.

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 A little for bread?

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 No.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Three points.

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Sometimes I'm light, sometimes I'm dark, sometimes I'm both.

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I know a light bulb.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 No.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 A pizza.

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 No.

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 No.

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 No.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 No.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 No.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 No.

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 No.

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 No.

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 No.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 No.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 No.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 No.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 No.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 No.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 No.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 No.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 No.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 No.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 No.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 No.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 No.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 No.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 No.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 No.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 No.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 No.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 No.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 No.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 No.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 No.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 No.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 No.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 No.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 No.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 No.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 No.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 No.

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 No.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
いただque.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Audrey.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Stop walking away from me.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 This is how you got to finish this conversation.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I've got about two minutes.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 What's he going?

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Okay, look at me.

113
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Last clip for all the points.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Everyone wants to welcome me.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Not only happy if you ever have.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Take your time.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Hey, bud.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Hey, mom, it's the game.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I'm trying today.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Sorry.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Very frank.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 How are you today?

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Well, Mrs. Billings.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Frank, can I take a look with mom?

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 I don't know.

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 It's not in the rules.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Come on.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 What's the point in having rules if you can't bend them?

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Okay.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Just this once.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Yeah!

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 All right.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Try some goods.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 It's round, but not always around.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's like sometimes a duck, sometimes a both, sometimes.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Everyone wants to walk on it.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Only a happy few ever have.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 That is a hard one.

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Tell me about it.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 The boom!

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Correct.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Woo!

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Good job.

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Good job.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 All right.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Come on.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 See you Monday.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I Frank, thanks.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Keep your snacks in the kitchen.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Bye, mom.

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Bye, honey.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Hey, he's really taken to you in the month he's been with us.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Likewise.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It's too bad you can't stay on after Tony gets back.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 He's just a favor.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I don't usually do this sort of a job.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I thought you were a professional driver.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 A different kind of driving.

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Well, we're all going to miss you when you're gone.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And...

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Thank you for what you did.

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 For what?

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 For turning the car around so the jack wouldn't have to see us fighting.

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 You really know kids don't you?

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I know fighting.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 He hasn't seen Jack in months.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And then when he gets back here all I can hear is what I'm doing wrong.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 I think that after being separated for a year that he would...

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 I'm sorry.

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 You don't have to hear this.

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 It's okay.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 What a swap of things you've done a great job with Jack.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Thank you.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Any time it can be of help is anything you need.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 It's really sweet of you Frank.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 You might have to take you up on it.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Oh, I almost forgot.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I'm supposed to take Jack to the doctor tomorrow morning for his annual checkup.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 But I'm organizing a surprise party for him.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Even though his birthday's not until next week.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 What are we doing?

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Well, while I decorate and his friends arrive, I was thinking if you wouldn't mind...

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I'll tell you, come on.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I feel kind of funny cutting into your weekend.

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I'm just picking up a friend at the airport later on in the day.

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 That's nice.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 What is?

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 The guy's on security say a bit of a loner.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 So it's just nice to hear you have a friend.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 He's not really a friend.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 He's French.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Look how you back.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Audrey, I'd like to finish our conversation.

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Well, if anything comes up between now and then you have myself.

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Nothing will come up, Mrs. Bellings.

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Audrey.

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Audrey?

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Yeah, look.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I'm coming for tomorrow.

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 No need.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Huh?

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Yeah!

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Ah!

204
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 The bone in the air will be changed.

205
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 You drive me to take it in not the mother.

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Even better.

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Thank you.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Is this table?

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Yes, it's still.

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 The antidote?

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 See you tomorrow, gentlemen.

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And in other news, the drug enforcement ministers of six Latin American countries arrived in Miami today for a summit meeting.

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Yeah.

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Come on, friend.

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 1156 pound that out.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 We have an express delivery.

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 That's what you told me 45 minutes ago.

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Come on, I don't need anything else.

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Just give me the pizza.

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 I'm not paying for that.

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Hi.

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Hi.

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 No idea.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 What's up, guys?

225
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 What's up, guys?

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Uh-uh.

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Audrey.

228
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 What are you doing?

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 What does it look like I'm doing?

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 We've been drinking.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 What's up?

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You said if I made it anything.

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I can't.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Why?

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Because I've been lying.

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Because of who I am.

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 I feel so lost, so confused.

238
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Who isn't?

239
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Thank you, Frank.

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 For the time.

241
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Respect.

242
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 I think that's what I needed the most.

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 I'm going to get a shot.

244
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 No, no.

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I'm going to get a shot.

246
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Uh.

247
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Jason, we're not open yet.

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 It's an emergency.

249
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I need to see the doctor immediately.

250
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Dr. Coblin, if you come out here, please, we have an issue.

251
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 You'll have to fill out some papers dating the medical problem.

252
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 It's not medical.

253
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's psychological.

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Yes, Laura.

255
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 What seems to be the problem?

256
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Me?

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Hate a shot.

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Number one, there's no guarantee you're getting a shot.

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 So there's no sense in getting all worked up over something

260
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 that might not happen.

261
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Give me the good news.

262
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Dr. Selle, I'm cured.

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Frank, it hurts a lot.

264
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 I'll never let anyone hurt you a lot.

265
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Promise?

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 You know my fourth rule?

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Never make a promise you can't keep.

268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Come on.

269
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Close your door.

270
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Come on.

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 May I help you?

272
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Check Billings to see Dr. Coblin.

273
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 I'm sorry. He's out sick today.

274
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 He'll be seeing Dr. Tyberg.

275
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I like Dr. Coblin.

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Don't worry. Dr. Tyberg's very nice.

277
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Now, if you'll just take him into room three.

278
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Where's Miss Laura?

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Who?

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 You're standing at her desk.

281
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 That Miss Laura. She's out sick too.

282
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 There's a lot of flu going around.

283
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Now, come on.

284
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Dr. Scott, a busy day.

285
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Come on.

286
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Never be over before you know it.

287
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Hey!

288
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I'm Dr. Tyberg.

289
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Can't I wait for my doctor?

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Unfortunately, your doctor was called away on emergency.

291
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 In that said, he had the flu.

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 That was the emergency. He came down with flu very quickly.

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 So, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish.

294
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Come, I show you something very cool.

295
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I'm sorry.

296
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Dr. Patients privacy in the room, but you can wait in reception area or glass of water.

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Okay. Trust me.

298
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And Dr. Police, it's from...

299
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Yeah.

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Hello, Frank.

301
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I'm here.

302
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 You're early.

303
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Yeah. We had fantastic telephones.

304
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 How tall are some of my vacation? Just like that.

305
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 From now on, it's the only way of flag-brank.

306
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Teleways are nothing.

307
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Where'd you made it?

308
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Hello?

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Sorry, Dr. Dunias is not in today. Call back my thing.

310
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Listen, Inspector, I'm a little tied up.

311
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 You mind taking a cab? You have the address, yes?

312
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Oh, thank you.

313
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Oh, you know, I heard the trees down here is fantastic.

314
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 I could fake us a bouillet bus.

315
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 You're like, we're the best, Frank, though.

316
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I'm gonna go.

317
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Frank!

318
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 You know, maybe it's better if you wait for his regular talk to the comeback.

319
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 It's very important that he receives immunizations.

320
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I'm sure it is.

321
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 But a week won't make a difference.

322
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 No, we're doing...

323
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 No!

324
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 No!

325
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 No!

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 No!

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 No!

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 No!

329
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Frank!

330
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Frank!

331
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Get going, Jack!

332
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Frank!

333
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Frank!

334
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Frank!

335
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Frank!

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Frank!

337
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Frank!

338
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Frank!

339
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Frank!

340
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Frank!

341
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Frank!

342
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Frank!

343
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Frank!

344
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Frank!

345
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Frank!

346
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Frank!

347
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Frank!

348
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Frank!

349
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Frank!

350
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Frank!

351
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Frank!

352
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Frank!

353
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Frank!

354
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Frank!

355
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Frank!

356
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Frank!

357
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Frank!

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Frank!

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Frank!

360
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Frank!

361
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Frank!

362
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Frank!

363
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Frank!

364
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Hear me?

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Look at me.

366
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Remember my promise?

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Yes!

368
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 I'm not.

369
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Uh-huh.

370
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Oh.

371
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Oh.

372
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Oh.

373
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Oh.

374
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Oh.

375
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Oh.

376
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Oh.

377
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Oh.

378
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Oh.

379
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Oh.

380
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Oh.

381
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Oh.

382
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Oh.

383
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 It's me!

384
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Get out!

385
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Frank.

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Frank.

387
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Shit.

388
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 The patient's not cooperating.

389
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Park the vehicle.

390
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Uh.

391
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Come on, hurry.

392
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.

393
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Freeze!

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Go up your order! Get down!

395
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Put your guns on the ground!

396
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Shit.

397
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Take out a way.

398
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Cut!

399
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Plan B?

400
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Yes, Plan B.

401
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Oh, he made it.

402
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Uh-huh.

403
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 What's that?

404
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Jack's birthday present.

405
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 baseball uniform, cleats, glove, and a bat.

406
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 It's his favorite sport.

407
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 It was last year.

408
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 He's on a soccer team now, and he's actually really good.

409
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 You know, you should see him sometime.

410
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Hello.

411
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Mr. and Mrs. Billy!

412
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 They're coming!

413
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Hi, everyone!

414
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Hi, everyone!

415
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Yes.

416
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Good morning, Mr. Driver.

417
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Who is this?

418
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Look in your review mirror when you see him with his...

419
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I know what you're thinking.

420
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Bulletproof glass.

421
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So now you tell me your experience

422
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 which judging from the little performers

423
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 who put on back at the office because way beyond

424
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 just driving children to school and back, does?

425
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Bulletproof glass.

426
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Stop at 7.62, I'm her busy ground.

427
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Sorry.

428
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Why'd you stop the car?

429
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 The motorway that I tried, I could either over 300 feet away.

430
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Come on, Frank, pick up.

431
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 None of this would have been necessary

432
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 if you had no screw up my life.

433
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 So now I'm going to tell you how to set things right.

434
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Someone is going to appear in a few seconds.

435
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 That's her in.

436
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Driver.

437
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Good boy.

438
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Hi.

439
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Leave it on.

440
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Personally, I hate kids.

441
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I don't know what your feelings are on the subject,

442
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 but if you ever want to have any, make no moves,

443
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 but the move I tell you to make.

444
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 You're in her hands now, have you come here?

445
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 They can be very gentle hands.

446
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 But they can be hands from hell. Trust me on this one.

447
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Trust him on this one.

448
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 You're a drive!

449
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Make a laugh!

450
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Make a laugh!

451
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 I said laugh!

452
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Make a laugh!

453
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Listen, we keep doing this your way.

454
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 But how many rides are left for me?

455
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 They're going to catch us.

456
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Let me do this by ways, no one gets hurt.

457
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Where's the gun in that?

458
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Let's take the fun for later.

459
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,079
 Mar士!

460
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,720
 Not bad!

461
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,200
 Your mother ever teached you to say thank you.

462
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,660
 Yeah, she tried and failed miserably.

463
00:28:58,259 --> 00:28:59,660
 I think we lost them.

464
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 Think again.

465
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
 Thought complete.

466
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,700
 Let's go.

467
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
 Whoo!

468
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
 You're worried.

469
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,200
 What do you mean you can't find him?

470
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,700
 He's one man in one car.

471
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,200
 He's a chauffeur for Christ's sake.

472
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
 Not exactly, sir.

473
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
 I think there's a possibility you may have been in on it.

474
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
 What's it possible?

475
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
 How would you know?

476
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
 He's been working here for a month.

477
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
 He could have been setting us up the whole time

478
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
 and you wouldn't own any different.

479
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
 You are such an expert on knowing people.

480
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
 His background.

481
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
 He's special forces.

482
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
 He had an elite commando unit for five years,

483
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
 specializing in search and destroy.

484
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
 In the internet of Lebanon, Syria, Sudan,

485
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
 the man is a hunter.

486
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
 I don't care what his skills are.

487
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
 I don't care where he's from.

488
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
 This is not a war zone.

489
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
 This is an American city.

490
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
 Where's my son?

491
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
 Where's my son?

492
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
 I don't care.

493
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,200
 I just couldn't laugh for the whole time.

494
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
 I don't care.

495
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
 I like it.

496
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
 Last stop.

497
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
 All out.

498
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
 You're quite a guy.

499
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
 Another time.

500
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
 Another time.

501
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
 Another time.

502
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
 Another time.

503
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
 Another time.

504
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
 Another place.

505
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
 You and me, maybe.

506
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
 The pleasure we get out.

507
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
 Beauty.

508
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
 Frank.

509
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
 Frank!

510
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
 Frank!

511
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
 Not what you expected when you reported for work this morning.

512
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
 Is it Frank?

513
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
 No?

514
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
 Is that what passes with witness?

515
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,200
 This is my friend.

516
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
 Wait.

517
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
 It's not a requirement of the job.

518
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
 Brutality.

519
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
 Yes.

520
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 An ability to inflict pain.

521
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
 Absolutely.

522
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
 Certain psychotic moral ignorance,

523
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
 blind obedience, or required.

524
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
 So not wait.

525
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,200
 I was a little bit in my love.

526
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
 What's this all about?

527
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
 A timely question.

528
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
 Max?

529
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
 Pardon me.

530
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
 Hello.

531
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,200
 Put me on the speaker so you don't have to repeat the instructions.

532
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,200
 The next two hours you get $500 in consequential $100 bills,

533
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
 you put them in a waterproof suitcase.

534
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
 You go to the bayfront park personally.

535
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,200
 There will be a blue Chrysler parked on the side.

536
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
 You place this suitcase in the trunk.

537
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
 I do.

538
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,200
 I don't know if I can get $5 million in two hours.

539
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
 Mr. Billings, please.

540
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
 I read the newspapers.

541
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
 The day you were appointed to your current position,

542
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
 your network exceeded $100 million.

543
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
 So you won't even feel the bite.

544
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,200
 What guarantee do I have that you won't harm my son?

545
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,200
 Garadillo, Mr. Billings.

546
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
 I'm not a car dealer.

547
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,200
 Don't let the charming accent and my grammatically impeccable syntax mislead you.

548
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
 I live in the jungle and in the jungle.

549
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
 You either eat or be eaten.

550
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
 But in the spirit of doing business here is the guarantee.

551
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
 10 minutes past the deadline.

552
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
 If the money doesn't arrive, I'll send a finger.

553
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
 20 minutes.

554
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
 Ah ha. 20 minutes.

555
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
 I'll fall.

556
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
 Sounds like we have a deal.

557
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
 Don't we, Mr. Billings?

558
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
 You have a deal.

559
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
 Could we please speak to our son?

560
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
 Mommy!

561
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
 Mommy!

562
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
 You have two hours, Mr. Billings.

563
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
 Starting now.

564
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
 You're my son.

565
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
 All right.

566
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
 Get the equipment.

567
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
 All right.

568
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,200
 Frank, you promised you wouldn't lie by her, mate.

569
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
 You promised.

570
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
 Never make promises you can't keep my friend.

571
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
 I don't.

572
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
 It's one of my rules.

573
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
 Wow.

574
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
 Bravo.

575
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
 A man who leaves his life by the rules.

576
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
 But in my word, rules are meant to be broken.

577
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
 Not mine.

578
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,200
 This time, we're going to have to make an exception.

579
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
 Go.

580
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,199
 Frank.

581
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,199
 Hey, driver.

582
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,199
 No, no, wait. Wait.

583
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,199
 A little distance between us isn't a bad thing.

584
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,199
 Let's go.

585
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,199
 Now.

586
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,199
 Hold on.

587
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,199
 Hello.

588
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,199
 It's me.

589
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,199
 You son of a bitch.

590
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,199
 Look, I had nothing to do with this.

591
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,199
 One hair out of place.

592
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,199
 Mr. Billings, let me speak to his in charge.

593
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,199
 Hello, Frank.

594
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,199
 This is you as much as Stabilin.

595
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,199
 You have to act fast.

596
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,199
 There are three boats.

597
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,199
 Cranky.

598
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,199
 Just tell us where you are.

599
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,199
 Get a plane up over the intercostal.

600
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,199
 Just tell me where you are, Frank.

601
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,199
 Just tell us where you are.

602
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:51,199
 Hello, Frank.

603
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,199
 Got it.

604
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,199
 Hello.

605
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,199
 Tell Coney it's me.

606
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,199
 Get out of the house.

607
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,199
 I know.

608
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,199
 I worked with pettings in my little town.

609
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,199
 Forget the medallins.

610
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,199
 Just get out.

611
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,199
 And go where?

612
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,199
 Anywhere.

613
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,199
 The beach. Go to the beach.

614
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,199
 Oh, the beach.

615
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,199
 The famous Miami Beach.

616
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,199
 Oh, my dream.

617
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:38,199
 I would love to go to the beach.

618
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,199
 Maybe not.

619
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,199
 Hey!

620
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,199
 How the fuck are you?

621
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:48,199
 I'm the cook.

622
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,199
 Oh, it's a mistake.

623
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,199
 A terrible mistake.

624
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,199
 Why we can't all just get on.

625
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,199
 No, no.

626
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,199
 I'm going to the beach.

627
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,199
 I'm going to the beach.

628
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,199
 I'm going to the beach.

629
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:12,199
 I'm going to the beach.

630
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,199
 I'm going to the beach.

631
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,199
 Hello.

632
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,199
 It's Frank.

633
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,199
 Don't hang up.

634
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:20,199
 Pretend it's someone else.

635
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,199
 Hi, Susan.

636
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,199
 Uh, no, I'm just here at home.

637
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,199
 I didn't do it, Audrey.

638
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,199
 She had a gun on Jack.

639
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,199
 I had no choice.

640
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,199
 Yeah.

641
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:33,199
 I saw that.

642
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,199
 What do you know?

643
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,199
 It's more than a kidnapping.

644
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,199
 They called and asked for ransom.

645
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,199
 The doctors they will think.

646
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:41,199
 They were trying to give Jack a shot.

647
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,199
 They had to ruptured them.

648
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:49,199
 Audrey, I promise Jack I wouldn't let anyone hurt him.

649
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,199
 I'm not going to break that promise.

650
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,199
 I'll call you back.

651
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,199
 Audrey.

652
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,199
 Is everything all right?

653
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:03,199
 It's a pretty stupid question to ask right now.

654
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,199
 Don't you think, Jeff?

655
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,199
 All right.

656
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,199
 So tell me again, Inspector Tarkone,

657
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:19,199
 why you didn't immediately identify yourself

658
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,199
 as a police officer?

659
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:27,199
 Oh, I was overwhelmed by the effectiveness of your operation.

660
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,199
 It's a sophistication of your recruitment.

661
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:34,199
 You know, I work in a small office in a small town.

662
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,199
 We only have small crimes.

663
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,199
 I must admit, I was a little insecure.

664
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,199
 And you and Frank Martin are friends, right?

665
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,199
 A friend.

666
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,199
 I wouldn't say exactly a friend.

667
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,199
 I know him.

668
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,199
 We have a relationship.

669
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,199
 A long relationship.

670
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,199
 Looks so long.

671
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,199
 But they found you cooking at his house.

672
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,199
 I'm French.

673
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,199
 So?

674
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,199
 We don't need to do someone for a long time in order to cook for them.

675
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,199
 It's our way of breaking the ice.

676
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,199
 For example, this sandwich in coffee,

677
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:03,199
 the so-grassier of the old family.

678
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,199
 It will put on me to sing so bad that it's not very good.

679
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,199
 Yeah, I know it sucks, but what's that got to do with anything?

680
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,199
 You have it too.

681
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

682
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

683
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:37,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

684
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

685
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:43,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

686
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

687
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

688
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

689
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

690
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

691
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

692
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

693
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

694
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,199
 Don't move.

695
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,199
 Smith.

696
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,199
 Drop it.

697
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,199
 Oh!

698
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:40,199
 Oh!

699
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:43,199
 Oh!

700
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,199
 Oh!

701
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,199
 Oh!

702
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,199
 Oh!

703
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,199
 Oh!

704
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:59,199
 Oh!

705
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,199
 Oh!

706
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,199
 Oh!

707
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,199
 Oh!

708
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:12,199
 Oh!

709
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,199
 Oh!

710
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,199
 You take your room.

711
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:22,199
 There's water.

712
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,199
 Are you sure this is safe?

713
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,199
 Look over here, soldier.

714
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,199
 We got you, government.

715
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,199
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.

716
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:44,199
 As my mother used to say, a meal is only limited by your imagination.

717
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,199
 It's Cambodian?

718
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,199
 It's called Cambodian.

719
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,199
 Crabodian.

720
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,199
 Crabodian.

721
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,199
 Crabodian.

722
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,199
 Crabodian.

723
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,199
 Where are you?

724
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:55,199
 Cooking.

725
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,199
 Cooking.

726
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,199
 Can you talk?

727
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,199
 Oh!

728
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:00,199
 Speak out a little bit with my mother.

729
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,199
 Mom!

730
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,199
 Please.

731
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:04,199
 Do you mind?

732
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,199
 Thank you.

733
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,199
 Viva-mong.

734
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,199
 Viva-mong.

735
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,199
 Viva-mong.

736
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,199
 Viva-mong.

737
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,199
 Tramina Ivey.

738
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,199
 Viva-mong.

739
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,199
 Viva-mong.

740
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,199
 I wish you put a treasure in the middle.

741
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,199
 Viva-mong.

742
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,199
 I asked you your cooking for.

743
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:18,199
 For the US marshals.

744
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:20,199
 Once they found my badge, they were very polite.

745
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:22,199
 They gave me a coffee in a sandwich.

746
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,199
 They wouldn't believe what passes for food in this place.

747
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,199
 But I'm correcting the situation.

748
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,199
 What they read from a shift to call back and confirm everything.

749
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:34,199
 Of course, that might take a while.

750
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,199
 He's never there.

751
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,199
 Anything about me?

752
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,199
 Yes.

753
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,199
 They're very interested about you.

754
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:41,199
 They want to know where you are.

755
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,199
 Where are you?

756
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,199
 No, if I'm very long.

757
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,199
 Listen, hold on.

758
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:53,199
 Do you have access to a computer?

759
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,199
 Oh.

760
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:57,199
 Is yours in having access to something decent to it?

761
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,199
 Oh, handsome fellow.

762
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,199
 Who is it?

763
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:17,199
 That's what I need to know.

764
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,199
 Do they have an IT program?

765
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,199
 You'll forgive me, bit.

766
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,199
 I'm not so used to this system.

767
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,199
 Back home, there is one computer for ten of us.

768
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:26,199
 So, how is it with you, Frank?

769
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:28,199
 It's a complicated story.

770
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:30,199
 You mean you aren't this shit?

771
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:31,199
 You might say that.

772
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,199
 In other words, you're not of a state.

773
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:34,199
 Ah.

774
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:39,199
 Well, a Russian biologist with advanced degrees

775
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,199
 from the state laboratory for biological warfare and cyber-e.

776
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,199
 Have you had a address?

777
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:47,199
 Miami, Park West, King Street, number 11.

778
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,199
 Number 11.

779
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,199

780
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:48,199

801
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:09,199
 Number 11.

802
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:10,199
 Number 11.

803
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:11,199

00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,199

819
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:27,199
 Number 11.

820
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:28,199
 Number 9.

821
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:29,199
 Number 11.

822
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:30,199

826
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:34,199
 Number 11.

827
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,199
 Number 11.

828
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,199
 Number 11.

829
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,199
 Number 11.

830
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:38,199
 Number 11.

831
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:39,199
 Number 11.

832
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,199
 Number 11.

833
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:41,439
 Number 11.

834
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,439
 Number 11.

835
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,199
 Number 11.

836
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,199
 Number 11.

837
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,199
 No, no, no!

838
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:47,199
 Yes!

839
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:52,199
 No, no, no!

840
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:54,199
 Yes!

841
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:58,199
 Help!

842
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:00,199
 Help!

843
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:02,199
 Hey!

844
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:07,199
 What are you doing?

845
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,199
 You want to catch your bus?

846
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,199
 Come on.

847
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,199
 Oh!

848
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,199
 What are you doing, driver?

849
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:33,199
 You got some gold on the one side, huh?

850
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,199
 Help!

851
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,199
 Help!

852
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:40,199
 Help!

853
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,199
 Help!

854
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:55,199
 What?

855
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:58,199
 I don't think you know.

856
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,199
 Help!

857
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,199
 Tell me about the doctor's office.

858
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,199
 The one where you try to stick the kid with this.

859
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:18,199
 Wanna tell me?

860
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:30,199
 Who knows what you're up to?

861
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:32,199
 Who knew that was left on?

862
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:34,199
 Obviously something no conducive to your good health.

863
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:36,199
 Which is all I needed to know in the first place.

864
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:38,199
 Have a good life.

865
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:41,199
 What's left of it?

866
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,199
 Help!

867
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,199
 Hey, I'm ready.

868
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,199
 Hey, I'm ready.

869
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:58,199
 I would post a base of the ramps.

870
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:00,199
 I'm a stone bear.

871
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:02,199
 Thanks.

872
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:04,199
 The ramps still haven't been picked up.

873
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,199
 What does that mean?

874
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:06,199
 Don't worry.

875
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:08,199
 Right now it means nothing.

876
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,199
 What if it's not just a kidnapping?

877
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:12,199
 I've worked in over 15 kidnappings in the past two years.

878
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:14,199
 You think that if they don't take the ramps,

879
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:16,199
 I'm going to get my son back?

880
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,199
 Audrey, don't make this any more complicated than it already is.

881
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,199
 I'm not making this complicated, Jefferson.

882
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,199
 It's because of your job.

883
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,199
 What is my job back to do with any of this?

884
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:26,199
 We became the targets.

885
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:28,199
 And no matter what any of you all think,

886
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:31,199
 the only one who's out there trying to get Jack back is Frank.

887
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,199
 Frank?

888
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:33,199
 The chauffeur?

889
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:34,199
 You spoke to Frank Martin.

890
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:35,199
 You didn't tell us about it?

891
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:36,199
 How are you doing talking to him?

892
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:39,199
 Because he's the last person who sought Jack alive.

893
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,199
 We found the boy.

894
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,199
 You're drunk.

895
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:10,199
 Get shut down.

896
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,199
 Hard drive, Blue.

897
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,199
 Give him another one in there.

898
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,199
 Yes, sir.

899
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,199
 How long is it going to take?

900
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:16,199
 I'm going as fast as I can.

901
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:18,199
 He can suffocate in there.

902
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:19,199
 Stay calm.

903
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:20,199
 It's my son!

904
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:21,199
 Audrey, let them work.

905
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:23,199
 Are you just going to sit there and do nothing?

906
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,199
 Audrey!

907
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:27,199
 Everyone is an expert on having with all of you!

908
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,199
 Audrey!

909
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:31,199
 Audrey!

910
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,199
 Audrey!

911
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:37,199
 Audrey!

912
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,199
 Are you okay?

913
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:02,199
 Are you going to the party?

914
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:09,199
 Breathe.

915
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:11,199
 Come on, breathe, everybody.

916
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:12,199
 You're the devil.

917
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:14,199
 I wish.

918
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:25,199
 Breathe.

919
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:26,199
 Breathe.

920
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,199
 Breathe.

921
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,199
 Breathe.

922
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:53,199
 Breathe.

923
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:54,199
 Breathe.

924
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:55,199
 Demetri!

925
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:56,199
 You're shitin' me.

926
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:57,199
 Where is some of it?

927
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:58,199
 He's in chamber.

928
00:50:58,199 --> 00:50:59,199
 I need to speak with him.

929
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,199
 He won't be long.

930
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:01,199
 I need to be listening up.

931
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,199
 Listen, Panasonic.

932
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:04,199
 It's rap music.

933
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:05,199
 It's good.

934
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:09,199
 Tuk, tuk.

935
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:13,199
 Ha!

936
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:14,199
 Ha!

937
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:15,199
 Ha!

938
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:16,199
 Oh my God.

939
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,199
 Ha!

940
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:47,199
 Ha!

941
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:18,199
 Ha!

942
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,199
 Ha!

943
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:20,199
 Ha!

944
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:21,199
 Ha!

945
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:22,199
 Ha!

946
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:23,199
 Ha!

947
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:24,199
 Ha!

948
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:25,199
 Ha!

949
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:26,199
 Ha!

950
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:27,199
 Ha!

951
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:28,199
 Ha!

952
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:29,199
 Ha!

953
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:30,199
 Ha!

954
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:31,199
 Ha!

955
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:32,199
 Ha!

956
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:33,199
 Ha!

957
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:34,199
 Ha!

958
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:36,199
 What are you doing?

959
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:37,199
 You're dead.

960
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:39,199
 Ha!

961
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,199
 Ha!

962
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,199
 Ha!

963
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,199
 Ha!

964
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:45,199
 What was that?

965
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:46,199
 I don't know.

966
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:48,199
 What are you doing here?

967
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,199
 I need an adult.

968
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,199
 The driver.

969
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:51,199
 He inject me with virus.

970
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:52,199
 What?

971
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:54,199
 Demetri, where would he get the virus?

972
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:55,199
 The one who left.

973
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:56,199
 In Dr. Sudgeri.

974
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:57,199
 Please.

975
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:58,199
 I need an adult.

976
00:52:58,199 --> 00:52:59,199
 I'm sick.

977
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:00,199
 Calm down.

978
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:01,199
 You're not sick.

979
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,199
 You have four hours before the virus is active.

980
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:05,199
 You know that.

981
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,199
 You're not creating it.

982
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,199
 Open-fliced.

983
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:09,199
 I'm telling you.

984
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:10,199
 Open-fliced.

985
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:11,199
 I'm telling you.

986
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:12,199
 Open-fliced.

987
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:13,199
 I'm telling you.

988
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:14,199
 Open-fliced.

989
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:15,199
 He's the need here.

990
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,199
 Open-fliced.

991
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,199
 Over the fridge.

992
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,199
 This insurance policy.

993
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:22,199
 How many will have two dollars?

994
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,199
 It's enough for TIPI than myself.

995
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,199
 People supposed he canceled.

996
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:28,199
 There is one for me.

997
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:29,199
 And I want it now.

998
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,199
 Come on.

999
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:31,199
 Come on.

1000
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:32,199
 What's going on?

1001
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:33,199
 Let's not.

1002
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:34,199
 Who are you?

1003
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:35,199
 Right.

1004
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:36,199
 I'm not.

1005
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:37,199
 I'm not.

1006
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:38,199
 I'm not.

1007
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:39,199
 I'm not.

1008
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,199
 I'm not.

1009
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:41,199
 I'm not.

1010
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:42,199
 I'm not.

1011
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:43,199
 I'm not.

1012
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:44,199
 Who are you?

1013
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:45,199
 Right.

1014
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:46,199
 There is enough for two of us.

1015
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:47,199
 You don't need it.

1016
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:48,199
 But you injected me.

1017
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,199
 With water.

1018
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:50,199
 I'm not sick.

1019
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:51,199
 Not sick.

1020
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:52,199
 Water.

1021
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:53,199
 Water.

1022
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,199
 Son of a bitch!

1023
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,199
 Good.

1024
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,199
 A problem is solved.

1025
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:58,199
 One does for each of us.

1026
00:53:58,199 --> 00:53:59,199
 Not for us.

1027
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:00,199
 One for you.

1028
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:01,199
 One for the child.

1029
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:02,199
 You're the version.

1030
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:03,199
 It's touching.

1031
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,199
 My patience is about to run out.

1032
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:06,199
 No.

1033
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:07,199
 Ah!

1034
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:08,199
 I'm scared.

1035
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:09,199
 Tell me about the virus.

1036
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:10,199
 Okay.

1037
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:11,199
 What you must know.

1038
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,199
 Everything.

1039
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:13,199
 The starters.

1040
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:14,199
 What is it?

1041
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,199
 It's a recombinant retroimmune double polymorphine, air flow.

1042
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:19,199
 The child will die.

1043
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:22,199
 Anyone who breathes on with die, then it's over.

1044
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:23,199
 You mean it, Soma?

1045
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:27,199
 You know this is designed to go in there after 24 hours.

1046
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,199
 Thanks for the lesson.

1047
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,199
 Now give me the files.

1048
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:33,199
 I'll give you the files.

1049
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:36,199
 You really want to play superhero, don't you?

1050
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:39,199
 Well, let's see if you can fly.

1051
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:40,199
 Oh, yeah.

1052
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:41,199
 Oh, yeah.

1053
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:42,199
 Oh, yeah.

1054
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:43,199
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,199
 Oh, yeah.

 Oh, yeah.

00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,199
 Oh, yeah.

1058
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,199
 Oh, yeah.

1059
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:48,199
 Oh, yeah.

1060
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:49,199
 Oh, yeah.

1061
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:50,199
 Oh, yeah.

1062
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:51,199
 Oh, yeah.

1063
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:52,199
 Oh, yeah.

1064
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:53,199
 Oh, yeah.

1065
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:54,199
 Oh, yeah.

1066
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:55,199
 Oh, yeah.

1067
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:56,199
 Oh, yeah.

1068
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:57,199
 Oh, yeah.

1069
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:58,199
 Oh, yeah.

1070
00:54:58,199 --> 00:54:59,199
 Oh, yeah.

1071
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:00,199
 Oh, yeah.

1072
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:01,199
 Oh, yeah.

1073
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:02,199
 Oh, yeah.

1074
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:03,199
 Oh, yeah.

1075
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:04,199
 Oh, yeah.

1076
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:05,199
 Oh, yeah.

1077
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:06,199
 Oh, yeah.

1078
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:07,199
 Oh, yeah.

1079
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:08,199
 Oh, yeah.

1080
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,199
 Oh, yeah.

1081
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:11,199
 Keg sä pisses.

1082
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:12,199
 Okay.

1083
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:13,199
 Okay.

1084
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:20,199
 Okay.

1085
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:22,199
 Okay.

1086
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:26,199
 Oh, yeah.

1087
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:28,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1088
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1089
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:32,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1090
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:34,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1093
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:40,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1094
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:42,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1095
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:44,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1096
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:46,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1097
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:48,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1098
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:50,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1099
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:52,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1100
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:54,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1101
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:55,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1102
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:57,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1103
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:59,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1104
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:01,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1105
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:03,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1106
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:05,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1107

 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1113
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:19,199
 I'm not sure if I can get the right one.

1114
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:27,199
 There's nothing to worry about.

1115
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:29,199
 There's just a simple viral infection

1116
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:31,199
 combined with the stress of what happened.

1117
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:33,199
 It should pass into the day or two.

1118
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,199
 I gave him something to help him sleep.

1119
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,199
 I gave him something to help him sleep.

1120
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:39,199
 Call me if anything arises.

1121
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:41,199
 Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

1122
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:43,199
 No, Audrey.

1123
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,199
 Oh, this is...

1124
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,199
 Well, it's made me realize what a fool I've been.

1125
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:51,199
 Jack.

1126
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,199
 And with you.

1127
00:56:57,199 --> 00:56:59,199
 Are you okay?

1128
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:02,199
 Mr. Billings, we're running late.

1129
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:04,199
 We'll be right out.

1130
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:07,199
 I'd like to come by after the conference.

1131
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,199
 Check on, check.

1132
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:12,199
 Check on you.

1133
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,199
 Good.

1134
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,199
 I'll see you soon.

1135
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:20,199
 They're here if you need them.

1136
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,199
 Are you all right, ma'am?

1137
00:57:34,199 --> 00:57:36,199
 I'm fine.

1138
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:41,199
 Hello?

1139
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:43,199
 It's me.

1140
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:44,199
 You're okay, Mrs. Billings.

1141
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:45,199
 I'll see you a bit, Dr.

1142
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:46,199
 Hi, Susan.

1143
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:47,199
 How are you?

1144
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,199
 I'm alone.

1145
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:53,199
 Where are you, Frank?

1146
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:55,199
 Turn around.

1147
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:07,199
 Frank, you were wrong.

1148
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:08,199
 It was a kidnapping.

1149
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:09,199
 Jack is fine.

1150
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,199
 Jack's been infected with a deadly virus or a drink.

1151
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:15,199
 Now anyone who comes into contact with him will die.

1152
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:17,199
 What are you telling me?

1153
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:20,199
 Are you telling me that my son is going to die?

1154
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:22,199
 No, he's not.

1155
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,199
 I want to think you're better the virus becomes airborne.

1156
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,199
 So when he breathes out, it gets infected.

1157
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,199
 Some was a weapon that targeted us this far.

1158
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:33,199
 Jefferson?

1159
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:34,199
 Oh, why?

1160
00:58:34,199 --> 00:58:36,199
 Because of the conference.

1161
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:38,199
 It's the only logical answer.

1162
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:40,199
 Drug enforcement agency in the hemisphere in one room.

1163
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:43,199
 Now, it's been breathed the room dies.

1164
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:46,199
 Oh, please.

1165
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:52,199
 You better trust me, Audrey.

1166
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,199
 Can you get to him?

1167
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:03,199
 What are you going to do?

1168
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:05,199
 I'm the guy responsible.

1169
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:07,199
 He has more of this.

1170
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:10,199
 For you and everybody else.

1171
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:12,199
 For you now.

1172
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:16,199
 We have a guest.

1173
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:18,199
 He burnt it up.

1174
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:19,199
 Okay.

1175
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:21,199
 You got to go.

1176
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:23,199
 Go.

1177
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,199
 Don't move!

1178
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:30,199
 We have a guest.

1179
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:33,199
 He burnt it up.

1180
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:35,199
 Okay.

1181
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:37,199
 You got to go.

1182
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:39,199
 Go.

1183
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:42,199
 Don't move!

1184
00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:59,199
 Ah!

1185
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:01,199
 Ah!

1186
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:03,199
 Ah!

1187
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,199
 Ah!

1188
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:07,199
 Ah!

1189
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:29,199
 Is the governor here?

1190
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,199
 Everybody's going to be here.

1191
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,199
 The governor delegates from all over the world.

1192
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:35,199
 It's just that.

1193
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,199
 Hello?

1194
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,199
 You can't go to the conference.

1195
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:39,199
 You got everything all right?

1196
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:41,199
 To give him a deadly vibe.

1197
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:42,199
 Audrey, I can't hear you.

1198
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:43,199
 I'm inside.

1199
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:44,199
 Now, I've got it.

1200
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:45,199
 And so do you.

1201
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:46,199
 Audrey, I can't hear you.

1202
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:48,199
 Their plan is to infect everyone at the conference.

1203
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:49,199
 I'm going to have to call you back.

1204
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:51,199
 Jeff.

1205
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:53,199
 You spill it.

1206
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:55,199
 You all right?

1207
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:57,199
 Come on.

1208
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:58,199
 Let's get you.

1209
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:21,199
 Hello?

1210
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:23,199
 You still a guest of the government?

1211
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:26,199
 You gave me the first accommodation.

1212
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:28,199
 Let me guess.

1213
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:31,199
 You know the computer.

1214
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:33,199
 It's practically my pillow.

1215
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:35,199
 So, I don't know.

1216
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:37,199
 I have nothing.

1217
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:41,199
 My favorite type of investigation.

1218
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:43,199
 Let's hear.

1219
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,199
 Hello.

1220
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:49,199
 I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to my delegates.

1221
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:50,199
 That's right.

1222
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:51,199
 Breathe, my friend.

1223
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:52,199
 Breathe.

1224
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:59,199
 Tomorrow, Mr. Bastard's are out of the way, and that corporation agreements are dead in

1225
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:00,199
 buried.

1226
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:03,199
 You know what your biggest problem is going to be?

1227
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:04,199
 Why?

1228
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:07,199
 Counting the money.

1229
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:11,199
 Can't wait for tomorrow.

1230
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,199
 Yeah, yeah.

1231
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:16,199
 Stay safe with me.

1232
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:19,199
 Johnny Chelindee.

1233
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:27,199
 The highest in South-Houth, when looking to make trouble, bugs, replicates, and that.

1234
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:30,199
 Someone access the database on the 15th floor.

1235
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:32,199
 That's Gonzalez.

1236
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:34,199
 He's on vacation.

1237
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:40,199
 He was behind the host, thus taking up the public ministers in Geneva.

1238
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:45,199
 It was a nice piece of work.

1239
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:48,199
 Give me an address.

1240
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:51,199
 Miami is Thailand, but he can drive number 26.

1241
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:53,199
 We found the car.

1242
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:55,199
 One great cop's on call.

1243
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:57,199
 Thank you for the compliment.

1244
01:02:57,199 --> 01:03:03,199
 Now, I'm great back to sleep.

1245
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:06,199
 Maybe not.

1246
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,199
 Oh, my God, man.

1247
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:09,199
 I'll call the wind.

1248
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,199
 It's over.

1249
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:11,199
 I'll do it.

1250
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:12,199
 Stop.

1251
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:15,199
 I'm sorry.

1252
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,199
 I'm sorry.

1253
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:18,199
 I'm sorry.

1254
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:20,199
 I'm sorry.

1255
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:23,199
 Mommy.

1256
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,199
 I think I'm better.

1257
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:28,199
 A little bit.

1258
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:31,199
 Should try to get back to sleep.

1259
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:40,199
 Man, are you alright?

1260
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:45,199
 Thanks.

1261
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:53,199
 Thanks, Robin.

1262
01:04:12,199 --> 01:04:15,199
 I'm sorry.

1263
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:18,199
 I'm sorry.

1264
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:21,199
 I'm sorry.

1265
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:24,199
 I'm sorry.

1266
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:27,199
 I'm sorry.

1267
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,199
 I'm sorry.

1268
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,199
 I'm sorry.

1269
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:36,199
 I'm sorry.

1270
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:39,199
 I'm sorry.

1271
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:42,199
 I'm sorry.

1272
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:45,199
 I'm sorry.

1273
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,199
 I'm sorry.

1274
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:51,199
 I'm sorry.

1275
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,199
 I'm sorry.

1276
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:57,199
 I'm sorry.

1277
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:00,199
 Okay, do it.

1278
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:03,199
 What are you doing?

1279
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,199
 You know, last night got me thinking.

1280
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:10,199
 How do you transport the antidote safely?

1281
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:12,199
 We need something that won't break.

1282
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,199
 Something that can't be stolen.

1283
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:17,199
 Something totally secure.

1284
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:19,199
 Me?

1285
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:33,199
 Impressive.

1286
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,199
 Get dressed.

1287
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:39,199
 Stop it.

1288
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,199
 Is this your friend?

1289
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:45,199
 Not yet.

1290
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,199
 Where'd they go?

1291
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,199
 Good boy.

1292
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:59,199
 I'm out of ammo.

1293
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:00,199
 Me too.

1294
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:01,199
 So am I.

1295
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:02,199
 Where are the reloads?

1296
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:05,199
 Good boy.

1297
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:06,199
 Check this.

1298
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:08,199
 Go, go, go!

1299
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:14,199
 Get in, get in!

1300
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:32,199
 Get in!

1301
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,199
 Get in!

1302
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:31,199
 Get in.

1303
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,199
 Get in!

1304
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,199
 What do you want me to do?

1305
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:53,199
 Keep the meda running.

1306
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:56,199
 But don't do it, baby.

1307
01:07:56,199 --> 01:07:58,519
 You're safe now, you're safe.

1308
01:07:58,519 --> 01:07:59,879
 You're so beautiful.

1309
01:07:59,879 --> 01:08:02,639
 We might need my yellow poop right now.

1310
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:58,199
 Ah!

1311
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:00,199
 Ah!

1312
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:02,199
 Ah!

1313
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:04,199
 Ah!

1314
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:06,199
 Ah!

1315
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:08,199
 Ah!

1316
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:10,199
 Ah!

1317
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:12,199
 Ah!

1318
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:14,199
 Ah!

1319
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:16,199
 Ah!

1320
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:20,199
 Don't move.

1321
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:22,199
 Oh, Mr. Driver.

1322
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:24,199
 Well, you and Tittumar.

1323
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:26,199
 But then I believe what you came for all over the floor

1324
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:28,199
 wouldn't want this for you.

1325
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:32,199
 Not after you walked so hard, tried to get to the antidote.

1326
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:34,199
 Take a good look, Frank Martin.

1327
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:36,199
 I'm a cure for what aids you.

1328
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:38,199
 I'm the only cure for what aids you.

1329
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:40,199
 I am the antidote.

1330
01:09:40,199 --> 01:09:42,199
 Ha, ha, ha.

1331
01:09:42,199 --> 01:09:44,199
 When I was dry, I'm impressed.

1332
01:09:44,199 --> 01:09:46,199
 Didn't give you enough credit to come over there and drive

1333
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:48,199
 or if you could just out.

1334
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:50,199
 I'm figured it all out yet.

1335
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:52,199
 Perhaps I can help you. What part are you a little, how you say?

1336
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:54,199
 Think of you.

1337
01:09:54,199 --> 01:09:56,199
 Why? Oh.

1338
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:58,199
 That's the easy part.

1339
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:00,199
 It's a business that you're pure and simple.

1340
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:02,199
 I'm for hire to the highest bidder.

1341
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:06,199
 And in this case, the highest bidder was the Colombian cocaine cartels

1342
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:10,199
 that wanted this pesky lumen afterpacks.

1343
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:12,199
 You really think killing all these politicians

1344
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:14,199
 is going to make things easier for them?

1345
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:16,199
 That's not my problem.

1346
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:18,199
 I was hard to do a job.

1347
01:10:18,199 --> 01:10:20,199
 I did the job.

1348
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:22,199
 My pay is better.

1349
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:24,199
 My hair and my suit too.

1350
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:30,199
 Oh, Lola.

1351
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:32,199
 Now if you'll excuse me, I have a claim to catch.

1352
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:36,199
 Okay, name it.

1353
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:38,199
 Charge out.

1354
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:44,199
 Don't have a blade.

1355
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:46,199
 We'll send this for you.

1356
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:48,199
 Pleasure.

1357
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:50,199
 You're killing me.

1358
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:20,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1359
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:22,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1360
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:24,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1361
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:26,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1362
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1363
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:30,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1364
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:32,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1365
01:11:32,199 --> 01:11:34,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1366
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:36,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1367
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:38,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1368
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:40,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1369
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:42,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1370
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:44,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1371
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1372
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1373
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:50,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1374
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:52,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1375
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1376
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:56,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1377
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:58,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1378
01:11:58,199 --> 01:12:00,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1379
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:02,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1380
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:04,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1381
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:06,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1382
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:08,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1383
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1384
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:12,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1385
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:14,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1386
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,199
 Ok, let's go.

1387
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,199
 Ok, let's go.

1388
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:20,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1389
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:24,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1390
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:26,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1391
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:28,199
 Ok, let's go.

1392
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:31,199
 I'm going to kill you.

1393
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,199
 Ok, let's go.

1394
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:34,199
 We're coming to you, sus.

1395
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:37,199
 We're coming to you.

01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,199
 Come here.

1398
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:43,199
 I'm coming to you.

1399
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,840
 There's another call that is swaying past the police

1400
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,679
 as if there was standing still.

1401
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:48,679
 Looks like...

1402
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:49,679
 So, Miss Kendra.

1403
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:50,880
 How nice of this one.

1404
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,880
 Yes, you can.

1405
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:42,880
 If clearance for takeoff is still in it, sit back and enjoy your flight and we will be

1406
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
 in Colombia before you know it.

1407
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,880
 Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Chalini.

1408
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,880
 Nothing to worry about.

1409
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:46,880
 Sorry.

1410
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,880
 Flight's been cancelled.

1411
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:57,880
 I'm sorry to inform you that you have been cancelled.

1412
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,880
 Never see it.

1413
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,880
 Relax.

1414
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,880
 Drink something.

1415
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,880
 Let's get to know each other.

1416
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:10,880
 I think I know everything I need to know.

1417
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,880
 I'm sorry.

1418
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:13,880

01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:14,380
 A hot dog.

 Wrong.

1648
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:30,380

 Yeah.

1650
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,380
 Didn't want you to miss your plane.

1651
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,380
 Is that very thoughtful of you?

1652
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,380
 My right to get out of here.

1653
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,380
 You'll buy me a food.

1654
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,380
 Check it off the bus.

1655
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:53,380
 You will believe I have to meet us like that.

1656
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,380
 I don't have something for you.

1657
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,380
 You'll figure it out since you've never got to the beach.

1658
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,380
 I know water, sand is sand,

1659
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,380
 it's all the same.

1660
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:11,380
 I have one like two or six nights in Paris.

01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,380
 Thank you Frank.

1662
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,380
 It was an interesting vacation.

1663
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:16,380
 What more could one ask for?

1664
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,380
 Yeah.

1665
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,380
 A laugh on it.

1666
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,380
 With one, my friend.

1667
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:22,380
 Have a good flight.

1668
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,380
 I doubt it.

1669
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:25,380
 So since it's old headlines.

1670
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,380
 I guess we can have everything we wish for it, can we?

1671
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:31,380
 No, we can't.

1672
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,380
 Yeah.

1673
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,380
