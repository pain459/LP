1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I'm so sorry. Can you help me? My tire.

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Sorry I have an appointment. I don't let it be late.

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Well, would you rather be late? Or dead.

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 You don't want to do this.

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Step out of the car.

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Woo! Let's go first! Come on, man!

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Yeah!

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Think it easy. The car's brand new.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 No problem, buddy. I've got this.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Baby, that's right.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Baby, baby, I can show you.

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Your parents know the kind of company you're keeping.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Shut up.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Shut up! It was my plan.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 The shame, working, man! It's coded.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 What's the code, man?

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm afraid I can't get it down.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Well, I'm afraid we'll have to beat it out.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Let's go get out of this car.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Get out of the car, baby. Come on, man.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Baby, what you got to be fair?

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 What you got to be fair?

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Keep doing it. Come on, baby.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Hold on.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 This came out of the dry, man.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Ah!

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Ah!

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Ah!

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Ah!

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Ah!

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Ah!

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Ah!

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Hands up!

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Stop moving, I will shoot you.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 What do you have home, what to do?

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Why don't you go and do it?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Okay. I'm sorry.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Light.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Ah!

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Ah!

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Ah!

42
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Ah!

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Ah!

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Ah!

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Ah!

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Ah!

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Hey, hey!

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 The game, the game, the game, the game!

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 What's the first rule one entering a man's car?

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Respect the man's car, and then respects you.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Rule number two.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Greet the man.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Good afternoon, Frank.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Good afternoon, Jack.

55
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Can we play the game now?

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 So you think your brain will be too tired after a whole day of school?

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 You're just afraid I'm gonna win.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I'm afraid you're gonna be too one out to do your homework.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It's Friday, I don't have any homework.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 In that case, the game.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Yes!

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But first, it's the third rule of the car.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Good.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Five points.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 A white, a round, but I'm not always around.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 A tennis ball.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 A tennis ball's a yellow.

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Four points.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Sometimes I'm habs, sometimes I'm whole, sometimes I'm slice of me as all you know.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 A little for bread?

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 No.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Three points.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Sometimes I'm light, sometimes I'm dark, sometimes I'm both.

74
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I know a light bulb.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 No.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 A pizza.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 No.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 A pizza.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 No.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 A pizza.

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 A pizza.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 A pizza.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 No.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 A pizza.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 No.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 No.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Audrey, stop walking away from me.

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Listen, I've got to finish this conversation.

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I've got about two minutes.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Where's he going?

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 He doesn't.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Okay, look at me.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Last clip for all the points.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Everyone wants to welcome me.

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Not only happy if you ever have.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Take your time.

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Hey, bud.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Hey, mom, it's the game.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I'm trying today.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Sorry.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Hey, Frank, how are you today?

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Well, Mrs. Billings.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Frank, can I take a look with mom?

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 I don't know.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It's not in the rules.

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Come on.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 What's the point in having rules if you can't bend them?

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Okay.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Just this once.

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Yeah!

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 All right.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Do you need some goods?

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 It's round, but not always around.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 It's like a ball.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 It's round, but not always around.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's like sometimes a duck, sometimes a both, sometimes.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Everyone wants to walk on it.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Only a happy few ever have.

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 That is a hard one.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Tell me about it.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 The ball!

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Correct.

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Good job.

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Good job.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 All right, come on.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 See you Monday.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Hi, Frank. Thanks.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Keep your snacks in the kitchen.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Bye, mom.

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Bye, honey.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 He's really taken to you in the month you've been with us.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Likewise.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It's too bad you can't stay on after Tony gets back.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 He's just a favor.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I don't usually do this sort of a job.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I thought you were a professional driver.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 A different kind of driving.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Well, we're all going to miss you when you're gone.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And...

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Thank you for what you did.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 For what?

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 For turning the car around so the jack wouldn't have to see us fighting.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 You really know kids don't you?

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 I know fighting.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 He hasn't seen jack in months.

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And then when he gets back here, all I can hear is what I'm doing wrong.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Think that you're going to be a good guy.

148
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I'm going to be a good guy.

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I'm going to be a good guy.

150
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I'm going to be a good guy.

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I'm going to be a good guy.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 I'm going to be a good guy.

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 But that's what I'm doing wrong.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Think that after being separated for a year that he would...

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I'm sorry.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 You don't have to hear this.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 It's okay.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 What a swap I think you've done a great job with Jack.

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Thank you.

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Any time it can be of help is anything you need.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 It's really sweet of you, Frank.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 You might have to take you up on it.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,799
 Oh, uh, I almost forgot.

164
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,200
 I'm supposed to take Jack to the doctor tomorrow morning

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,399
 for his annual checkup, but I'm organizing a surprise party

166
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,399
 for him, even though his birthday's not until next week.

167
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,399
 What are we doing?

168
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,399
 I'm going to go for a few days.

169
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,799
 Oh, while I decorate, and his friends arrive,

170
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,200
 I was thinking if you wouldn't mind.

171
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
 I'll tell you, Kim.

172
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,399
 I feel kind of funny cutting into your weekend.

173
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,200
 Just picking up a friend at the airport later on in the day.

174
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
 Hmm.

175
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
 That's nice.

176
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
 What is?

177
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,800
 The guy's on security, say, a bit of a loner.

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,400
 So it's just nice to hear you have a friend.

179
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,800
 He's not really a friend.

180
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,400
 He's French.

181
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
 Look how you back.

182
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
 Audrey, I'd like to finish our conversation.

183
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 Well, if anything comes up between now and then you have myself.

184
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,800
 Nothing will come up with this, his feelings.

185
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
 Audrey.

186
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,000
 Audrey.

187
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,199
 Yeah, hello.

188
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:21,599
 I'm coming for tomorrow.

189
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,599
 My name.

190
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,799
 Yeah.

191
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 The murder you gave, will we change?

192
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 You drive me to take it in not the mother.

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Even better.

194
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,799
 Where am I?

195
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,799
 Who shot?

196
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,799
 Thank you.

197
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,599
 Is this table?

198
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,399
 Yes, it's still.

199
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,399
 The antidote?

200
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,799
 See you tomorrow, John.

201
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,799
 And in other news, the drug-eaten force administers of six Latin American countries

202
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,799
 arrived in Miami today for a summit meeting

203
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,799
 with Jefferson building.

204
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:09,799
 Come on, Frank.

205
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,799
 1156 Palmello, way for an express delivery.

206
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,799
 That's what you told me 45 minutes ago.

207
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,599
 Well, I don't need anything else.

208
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,599
 Just give me the pizza.

209
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,599
 I'm not paying for that.

210
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,599
 Hi.

211
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:24,599
 Hi.

212
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:31,599
 So, Mr. Martin, that's one medium-time, no mozzarella, extra olives, and extra anchovies,

213
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:34,000
 which amounts to 1155.

214
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,599
 I hope you're hungry.

215
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,000
 You have no idea.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I apologize for the delay, sir.

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,399
 Okay, I'll just...

218
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,399
 What's the noise?

219
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,399
 Uh-uh.

220
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,399
 Audrey.

221
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,399
 What are you doing?

222
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,399
 What does that look like I'm doing?

223
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,399
 We've been drinking.

224
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,399
 What's all that?

225
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 So, if I made it anything...

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 What can't?

227
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
 Why?

228
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
 Because of who I am?

229
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,799
 Because of who I am.

230
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,600
 I feel so lost, so confused.

231
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 What was it?

232
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,799
 Thank you, Frank.

233
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,199
 For the time...

234
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
 I'm trying...

235
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
 ...respect.

236
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
 I think that's what I needed the most.

237
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
 Frank.

238
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,600
makoo.

239
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,440
 What else can we do?

240
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,000
 What are we gonna do?

241
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,379
 No, no.

242
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 Oh.

243
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:53,620
 Jesus, we're not open yet.

244
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,620
 It's an emergency.

245
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
 I need to see the doctor immediately.

246
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,620
 Right.

247
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,980
 Dr. Coblin, if you'll come out here please we have an issue.

248
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,800
 You'll have to fill out some papers dating the medical problem.

249
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 Actually?

250
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,259
 My problem is not medical.

251
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,259
 It's psychological.

252
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,259
 Yes Laura.

253
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,759
 What seems to be the problem?

254
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:14,539
 Well for me.

255
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,559
 Hating shots.

256
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,059
 Number 1 is no gallon till you're getting shot.

257
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:25,059
 So there's no senON getting old what's up with something that I don't have.

258
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,059
 Give me the good news.

259
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,059
 Doctor said I'm cured.

260
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:31,059
 Frank, it hurts a lot.

261
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:33,059
 I'll never let anyone hurt you a lot.

262
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,059
 Mama's?

263
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,059
 You know my fourth rule?

264
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,059
 Never make a promise you can't keep.

265
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,059
 Come on.

266
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,059
 Close the door.

267
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:44,059
 I can't keep.

268
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:46,059
 Come on.

269
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:48,059
 Close the door.

270
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,059
 Eh.

271
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,059
 Come on.

272
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,059
 May I help you?

273
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,059
 Check Billings to see Dr. Kaplan.

274
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,059
 I'm sorry. He's out sick today.

275
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,059
 I like Dr. Koblo.

276
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,059
 Don't worry. Dr. Taibook's very nice.

277
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,059
 Now if you'll just take him into room three.

278
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,059
 Where's Miss Laura?

279
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:21,059
 Who?

280
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,059
 You're standing at her desk.

281
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,059
 That Miss Laura.

282
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,059
 She's out sick too.

283
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,059
 There's a lot of flu going around.

284
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:27,059
 Now come on.

285
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,059
 Doctor's got a busy day.

286
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:29,059
 Come on.

287
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:31,059
 I'll be over before you know it.

288
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:35,059
 Hey!

289
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,059
 I'm Dr. Taibook.

290
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,059
 Can't I wait for my doctor?

291
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,059
 Unfortunately, your doctor was called away.

292
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:44,059
 On emergency.

293
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,059
 In that said he had the flu.

294
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:47,059
 That was the emergency.

295
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,059
 He came down with flu very quickly.

296
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,059
 So, the sooner we start, the sooner we finish.

297
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:54,059
 Eh?

298
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,059
 Come. I show you something very cool.

299
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,059
 I'm sorry.

300
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,059
 Dr. Patient privacy in the room.

301
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,059
 But you can wait in reception area or glass of water.

302
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,059
 Okay. Trust me.

303
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:09,059
 And Dr.

304
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,059
 Please, it's a phone.

305
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,059
 Yeah.

306
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,059
 And I know.

307
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,059
 Frank, I'm here.

308
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,059
 You're early.

309
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:21,059
 Yeah. We had fantastic telephones.

310
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,059
 How far is my vacation?

311
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,059
 Just like that.

312
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,059
 From now on, it's the only way of flag-rank.

313
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:28,059
 Telephones are nothing.

314
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:30,059
 Where'd you made it?

315
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:33,059
 Hello?

316
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,059
 Sorry, Dr. Dunias is not in today.

317
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,059
 Call back my thing.

318
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,059
 I'm going to call.

319
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,059
 I'm going to call.

320
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:45,059
 Frank!

321
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,059
 You know, maybe it's better if you wait for his regular doctor to come back.

322
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,059
 It's very important that he receives immunizations.

323
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:53,059
 I'm sure it is.

324
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,059
 But a week won't make a difference.

325
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:57,059
 I'm sure it is.

326
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,059
 I'm sure it is.

327
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:01,059
 But a week won't make a difference.

328
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,059
 I'm sure it is.

329
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,059
 I'm sure it is.

330
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,059
 I'm sure it is.

331
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:07,059
 I'm sure it is.

332
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:09,059
 But a week won't make a difference.

333
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,059
 No, we're doing...

334
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:11,059
 No!

335
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,059
 Get going, Jack!

336
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,059
 Get going, Jack!

337
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:09,059
 Get going, Jack!

338
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:39,059
 I'm coming.

339
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,059
 Look at me.

340
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:43,059
 Remember my promise?

341
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,059
 Yes.

342
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,059
 I heard.

343
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,059
 Remember my promise?

344
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:51,059
 Yes.

345
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:13,059
 It's me!

346
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,059
 Get out!

347
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,059
 Frank!

348
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,059
 Shit.

349
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,059
 The patient's not cooperating.

350
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:04,059
 The car's the vehicle.

351
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,059
 Come on, Harry.

352
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:27,059
 Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay.

353
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,059
 Frank!

354
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,059
 Frank!

355
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,059
 Get down!

356
00:22:58,059 --> 00:22:59,059
 Get down!

357
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,059
 I'm not strong.

358
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:03,059
 Take out a way.

359
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,059
 Cut!

360
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:06,059
 Plan B?

361
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,059
 Yes, Plan B.

362
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,059
 Oh, he made it.

363
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:22,059
 Uh-huh.

364
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:24,059
 What's that?

365
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,059
 Jack's birthday present.

366
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,059
 baseball uniform, cleats, glove, and a bat.

367
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:31,059
 It's his favorite sport.

368
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,059
 It was last year.

369
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:37,059
 He's on a soccer team now and he's actually really good.

370
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:40,059
 You know, you should see him sometime.

371
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:42,059
 He's got a lot of things to do.

372
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,059
 He's got a lot of things to do.

373
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:46,059
 He's really good.

374
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,059
 You know, you should see him sometime.

375
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,059
 Hello?

376
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,059
 Mr. and Mrs. Billings, they're coming!

377
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:54,059
 Hi, everyone!

378
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:02,059
 Yes.

379
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,059
 Good morning, Mr. Driver.

380
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:05,059
 Who is this?

381
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:07,059
 You're looking at your review, Miro.

382
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,059
 And you see him with his?

383
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,059
 I know what you're thinking.

384
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:13,059
 We'll approve class.

385
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:16,059
 This is a rich judging from the little performance.

386
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:20,059
 You put on back at the office because way beyond just driving children to school and back.

387
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,059
 That's...

388
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,059
 I'll approve class.

389
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,059
 Stop at 7.62, I'm replacing round.

390
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:25,059
 Wait.

391
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:27,059
 Why'd you stop the car?

392
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,059
 The border will be that way.

393
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:33,059
 They're over 300 feet away.

394
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,059
 Come on, Frank. Pick up.

395
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:38,059
 None of this would have been necessary if you had no screw up my life.

396
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,059
 So, now I'm going to tell you how to set things right.

397
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,059
 Someone is going to appear in a few seconds.

398
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,059
 I'm going to get you.

399
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:57,059
 Let her in.

400
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:06,059
 Driver.

401
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,059
 Good boy.

402
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,059
 Hi.

403
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:19,059
 Leave it on.

404
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,059
 Personally, I hate kids.

405
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,059
 I don't know what your feelings are on the subject,

406
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:28,059
 but if you ever want to have any, make no moves,

407
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,059
 but the move I tell you to make.

408
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:33,059
 You're in her hands now, will you come here?

409
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,059
 They can be very gentle hands.

410
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:38,059
 They can be hands from hell. Trust me on this one.

411
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:40,059
 Trust him on this one.

412
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:42,059
 You're a drive.

413
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:46,059
 You're a drive.

414
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:16,059
 You're a drive.

415
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:19,059
 You're a drive.

416
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:22,059
 You're a drive.

417
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,059
 You're a drive.

418
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:27,059
 Make a laugh.

419
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,059
 I said laugh.

420
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,059
 Listen, keep doing this.

421
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,059
 You're awake.

422
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,059
 But how many rides did we make?

423
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,059
 They're going to catch us.

424
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:38,059
 Let me do this by way.

425
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:39,059
 So no one gets hurt.

426
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,059
 Where's the front of that?

427
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:42,059
 Let's save the front for later.

428
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,059
 Listen, keep doing this.

429
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:46,059
 You're awake.

430
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:48,059
 But how many rides did we make?

431
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,059
 They're going to catch us.

432
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:50,059
 Let me do this by way.

433
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:51,059
 So no one gets hurt.

434
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,059
 Where's the front of that?

435
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:54,059
 Let's save the front for later.

436
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,059
 We do this by way.

437
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,059
 So no one gets hurt.

438
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:57,059
 Where's the front of that?

439
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,059
 Let's save the front for later.

440
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:57,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

441
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

442
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:01,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

443
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

444
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

445
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

446
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:09,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

447
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

448
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

449
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

450
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

451
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:19,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

452
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:21,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

453
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:23,059
 I'm going to get the front of that.

454
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:25,059
 Let's go south.

455
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,059
 Not bad.

456
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:52,059
 Not bad.

457
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:53,059
 Not bad.

458
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:55,359
 Did your mother ever teach you to say thank you?

459
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,059
 Yeah.

460
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:58,359
 She tried and failed miserably.

461
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,659
 I think we lost them.

462
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:01,659
 Think again.

463
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:08,759
 Thought complete.

464
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,259
 Let's go.

465
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,059
 Who's the man?

466
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,059
 Who's the man?

467
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:39,059
 You're worried.

468
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:41,059
 What do you mean you can't find him?

469
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:42,659
 He's one man in one car.

470
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,359
 He's a chauffeur for Christ's sake.

471
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,559
 Not exactly, sir.

472
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,659
 I think there's a possibility you may have been in on it.

473
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:49,059
 What's it possible?

474
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,559
 How would you know?

475
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,259
 He's been working here for a month.

476
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,159
 He could have been setting this up the whole time

477
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,259
 and you wouldn't own any different.

478
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,759
 You are such an expert on knowing people.

479
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,759
 His background.

480
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,159
 He's special forces.

481
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,759
 He didn't leave commando unit for five years,

482
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,259
 specialized in search and destroy.

483
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:08,259
 Been in and out of Lebanon, serious or down?

484
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:09,460
 The man is out there.

485
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,659
 I don't care what his skills are.

486
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,059
 I don't care where he's from.

487
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,460
 This is not a war zone.

488
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,259
 This is an American city.

489
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:16,259
 Where's my son?

490
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,059
 That dance...

491
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:33,759
 Something went wrong...

492
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,159
 Something went wrong...

493
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,359
 Something went wrong...

494
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,460
 I lied to you...

495
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,599
 Just let yourselves...

496
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,599
 You're quite a guy.

497
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,599
 Another time.

498
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,599
 Another place.

499
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,599
 You and me maybe.

500
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,599
 The pleasure we get out.

501
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,599
 Beauty.

502
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,599
 Frank.

503
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,599
 Frank!

504
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,599
 Frank!

505
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,599
 Not what you expected when you reported for work this morning.

506
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,599
 Is it, uh, Frank?

507
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:21,599
 No.

508
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,599
 Is that what passes with witness, sir?

509
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,599
 This is my friend.

510
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:26,599
 With?

511
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,599
 It's not a requirement of the job.

512
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,599
 Brutality.

513
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,599
 Yes.

514
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,599
 An ability to inflict pain, absolutely.

515
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,599
 Certain psychotic moral ignorance, blind obedience, or repired.

516
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,599
 So not with?

517
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,599
 I was it.

518
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,599
 Fine.

519
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,599
 You didn't begin in my life.

520
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,599
 What's this all about?

521
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,599
 A timely question.

522
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,599
 Max?

523
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,599
 Pardon me.

524
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,599
 Hello.

525
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,599
 Put me on the speaker so you don't have to repeat instructions.

526
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,599
 The next two hours you get $500 in consequential $100 bills,

527
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,599
 you put them in a waterproof suitcase.

528
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,599
 You go to the bayfront park personally.

529
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,599
 There will be a blue Chrysler parked on the sand.

530
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,599
 You place this suitcase in the trunk.

531
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,599
 I do.

532
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,599
 I don't know if I can get $5 million in two hours.

533
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,599
 Mr. Billings, please, I read the newspapers.

534
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,599
 The day you were appointed to your current position,

535
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,599
 your network exceeded $100 million.

536
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,599
 So?

537
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,599
 You won't even feel the bite.

538
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,599
 What?

539
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,599
 Guaranteed or I have it.

540
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,599
 You won't harm my son.

541
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,599
 Guaranteed, Mr. Billings.

542
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,599
 I'm not a car dealer.

543
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,599
 Don't let the charming accent and my grammatically impeccable syntax mislead you.

544
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,599
 You are leaving the jungle and in the jungle.

545
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,599
 You either eat or be eaten.

546
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:47,599
 But in the spirit of doing business here is the guarantee.

547
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,599
 10 minutes past the deadline.

548
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,599
 If the money doesn't arrive, I'll send a finger.

549
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,599
 20 minutes.

550
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,599
 Ah ha.

551
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,599
 20 minutes.

552
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,599
 I thought.

553
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,599
 Sounds like we have a deal.

554
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,599
 Don't we miss the billings?

555
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,599
 You have a deal.

556
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,599
 Could we please speak to our son?

557
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,599
 Mommy!

558
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,599
 Mommy!

559
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,599
 You have two hours, Mr. Billings.

560
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,599
 Starting now.

561
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,599
 You're my son.

562
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,599
 Alright.

563
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,599
 Alright.

564
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,599
 Frank, you promised you wouldn't marry me.

565
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:24,599
 You promised!

566
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,599
 Never make promises you can't keep my friend.

567
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,599
 I don't.

568
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:31,599
 It's one of my rules.

569
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,599
 Wow.

570
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,599
 Bravo.

571
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,599
 A man who leaves his life by the rules.

572
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,599
 But in my word, rules are meant to be broken.

573
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,599
 Not mine.

574
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,599
 This time we're going to have to make an exception.

575
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,599
 Go.

576
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,599
 Frank.

577
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,599
 Take driver.

578
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,599
 No, no, wait.

579
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,599
 Wait. Wait.

580
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,599
 A little distance between us isn't a bad thing.

581
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,599
 Andiamo!

582
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,599
 Now.

583
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,599
 Hold on.

584
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,599
 Ah!

585
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,599
 Hello.

586
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,599
 It's me.

587
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,599
 We got them here, gentlemen.

588
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,599
 You son of a bitch.

589
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,599
 Look, I had nothing to do with this.

590
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,599
 Watch scratch on his head.

591
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,599
 One hair out of place.

592
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,599
 Mr. Billings, let me speak to you.

593
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,599
 It's in charge.

594
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,599
 Hello, Frank.

595
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,599
 This is you as much as David.

596
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,599
 You have to act fast.

597
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,599
 There are three boats.

598
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,599
 Just tell us where you are.

599
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,599
 Get a plane up over the interco-stalk.

600
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,599
 Just tell me where you are, Frank.

601
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,599
 Just tell us where you are.

602
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,599
 Hello, Frank.

603
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,599
 Got it.

604
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,599
 Hello.

605
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,599
 Tell Coney it's me.

606
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,599
 Get out of the house.

607
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,599
 I know.

608
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,599
 We're just pretzins in Madeline.

609
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,599
 Forget the Madelins.

610
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,599
 Just get out.

611
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,599
 And go where?

612
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,599
 Anywhere.

613
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,599
 The beach.

614
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:15,599
 Go to the beach.

615
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,599
 Oh, the beach.

616
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,599
 I know.

617
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,599
 I know.

618
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,599
 Yeah.

619
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,599
 You know, I know.

620
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,599
 You know.

621
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,599
 I know.

622
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,599
 You know.

623
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,599
 I know.

624
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,599
 I know.

625
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:27,599
 I know.

626
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,599
 I know.

627
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:29,599
 I know.

628
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,599
 I know.

629
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:31,599
 I know.

630
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,599
 Oh, the beach.

631
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,599
 Well, the famous Miami Beach.

632
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,599
 Oh, my dream.

633
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,599
 I would love to go to the beach.

634
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,599
 Maybe not.

635
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,599
 Hey!

636
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,599
 How the fuck are you?

637
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,599
 I'm the cook.

638
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,599
 Oh, it's a mistake.

639
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,599
 A terrible mistake.

640
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,599
 Why we can't all just get on now.

641
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,599
 Oh, no.

642
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,599
 Hello?

643
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,599
 It's Frank.

644
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,599
 Don't hang up.

645
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,599
 Pretend it's someone else.

646
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,599
 Nice season.

647
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,599
 Uh, no, I'm just here at home.

648
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,599
 I didn't do it, Audrey.

649
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:29,599
 She had a gun on Jacka.

650
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,599
 I had no choice.

651
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,599
 Yeah.

652
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,599
 I saw that.

653
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,599
 What do you know?

654
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,599
 It's more than a kidnapping.

655
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,599
 They called and asked for a ransom.

656
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,599
 The doctors, they will think.

657
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,599
 They were trying to give Jacka shot.

658
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,599
 What are you interrupted them?

659
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,599
 Audrey, I promise Jacka wouldn't let anyone hurt him.

660
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,599
 I'm not going to bring that promise.

661
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,599
 I'll call you back.

662
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,599
 Audrey.

663
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,599
 Is everything all right?

664
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,599
 It's a pretty stupid question to ask right now.

665
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,599
 Don't you think, Jeff?

666
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,599
 All right.

667
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,599
 So tell me again, Inspector Tarkone,

668
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,599
 why you didn't immediately identify yourself as a police officer?

669
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,599
 I was overwhelmed by the effectiveness of your preparation.

670
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,599
 It's a sophistication, if you were a good one.

671
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,599
 You know, I work in a small office in a small town.

672
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,599
 We only have small crimes.

673
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,599
 I must admit, I was a little insecure.

674
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,599
 And you and Frank Martin are friends, right?

675
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,599
 A friend.

676
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:43,599
 I wouldn't say exactly a friend.

677
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,599
 I know him.

678
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,599
 We have a relationship.

679
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,599
 A long relationship.

680
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,599
 Hmm, not so long.

681
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,599
 But they found you cooking at his house.

682
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,599
 I'm French.

683
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,599
 So?

684
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:55,599
 We don't need to do someone for a long time in order to cook for them.

685
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,599
 It's our way of breaking the ice.

686
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,599
 Take, for example, this sandwich in coffee.

687
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,599
 It's so grusty or friendly.

688
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,599
 You will put on a metrosync, so bad it's not very good.

689
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,599
 Yeah, no, it sucks.

690
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,599
 What's that got to do with anything?

691
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,599
 You have it too.

692
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

693
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

694
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:31,599

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,599

715
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,599

743
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

744
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

745
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

746
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,599
 Don't move.

747
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:27,599
 Smith.

748
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,599
 Drop it.

749
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,599
 Oh!

750
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,599
 Oh!

751
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,599
 Oh!

752
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,599
 Oh!

753
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,599
 Oh!

754
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,599
 Oh!

755
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,599
 Are you sure this is safe?

756
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:25,599
 Look over here, shoulder.

757
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,599
 We got you covered.

758
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:42,599
 As my mother used to say, a meal is only limited by your imagination.

759
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:43,599
 It's Cambodian?

760
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,599
 It's a cognizant.

761
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:45,599
 Creme Brillet.

762
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,599
 Cambodian?

763
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,599
 Caught?

764
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,599
 Caught mischir.

765
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:49,599
 Caught mischir.

766
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,599
 Where are you?

767
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:51,599
 Cooking.

768
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,599
 Cooking.

769
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:53,599
 Can you talk?

770
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,599
 Oh.

771
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,599
 Speak out of this.

772
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

773
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:57,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

774
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

775
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

776
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,599
 Speak out of this.

777
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,599
 I'm going to put it on the table.

778
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,599
 Mom!

779
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:03,599
 Please.

780
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:04,599
 Do you mind?

781
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,599
 Thank you.

782
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,599
 Vivaanmong.

783
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,599
 Vivaanmong.

784
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,599
 Vivaanmong.

785
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:09,599
 Tramina Ivey.

786
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,599
 Vivaanmong.

787
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,599
 Tramina Ivey.

788
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,599
 I wish you a pleasant trip.

789
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,599
 Vivaanmong.

790
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,599
 I asked you a cooking for.

791
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,599
 For the US marshals.

792
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,599
 Once they found my badge, they were very polite.

793
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,599
 They gave me a coffee in a sandwich.

794
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,599
 They wouldn't believe what passes for food in this place, Frank.

795
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,599
 But I'm correct in this situation.

796
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,599
 What they read from a shift to call back and confirm everything.

797
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,599
 Of course, that might take a while.

798
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,599
 He's never there.

799
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:35,599
 Anything about me?

800
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,599
 Yes.

801
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,599
 There are very interesting about you.

802
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,599
 I want to know where you are.

803
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,599
 Where are you?

804
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,599
 No, if I'm very long.

805
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,599
 Listen, hold on.

806
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,599
 Do you have access to a computer?

807
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,599
 Is yours in having access to something decent to it?

808
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,599
 Oh.

809
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,599
 And some fellow.

810
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,599
 Who is it?

811
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,599
 It's what I need to know.

812
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,599
 Do they have an IT program?

813
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:06,599
 You'll forgive me, bit.

814
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,599
 I'm not so used to this system.

815
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:11,599
 Back home there is one computer for ten of us.

816
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,599
 So, I'm not sure if you're right.

817
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,599
 I've been doing this for a long time.

818
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,599
 I'm not sure if you're right.

819
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,599
 I'm not sure.

820
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,599
 I'm not sure.

821
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:20,599
 It's the same.

822
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,599
 Not sure if you're right.

823
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:23,599
 I'm not sure.

824
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,599
 I'm not sure.

825
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:26,599
 So, I'll leave you to the system.

826
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:29,599
 Back home there is one computer for ten of us.

827
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,599
 So, how is it with you, Frank?

828
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,599
 I said complicated story.

829
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,599
 Are you being around this shit?

830
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:36,599
 I'd say that.

831
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:39,599
 In other words, you're not of a state.

832
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,599
 Ah.

833
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,599
 Well, Russian biologist.

834
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,599
 We've had to run this.

835
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:48,599
 Degrees from the state laboratory for biological warfare and cyber.

836
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,400
 But----

837
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:50,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

838
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:52,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

839
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

840
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

841
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

842
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:00,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

843
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

844
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

845
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:06,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

846
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:08,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

847
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:10,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

848
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

849
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

850
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:16,599
 I'm not going to let you down.

851
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,400
 I'm not going to let you down.

852
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
 No!

853
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
 No!

854
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
 No!

855
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
 No!

856
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
 No!

857
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
 Get out!

858
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,400
 No!

859
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,400
 No!

860
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
 No!

861
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
 No!

862
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
 No!

863
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
 No!

864
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
 No!

865
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,400
 No!

866
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
 No!

867
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
 No!

868
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
 No!

869
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
 No!

870
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
 No!

871
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
 What is happening?

872
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
 You want to catch your bus?

873
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
 No!

874
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 Come on!

875
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
 No!

876
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
 No!

877
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
 No!

878
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
 No!

879
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,400
 No!

880
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
 What are you doing, driver?

881
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
 That's so cool, that's what I was, I know!

882
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
 No!

883
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,400
 No!

884
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
 No!

885
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,400
 No!

886
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,400
 No!

887
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,400
 No!

888
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
 No!

889
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
 No!

890
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,400
 No!

891
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,400
 No!

892
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
 No!

893
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
 No!

894
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,400
 No!

895
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
 No!

896
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
 No!

897
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,400
 No!

898
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
 No!

899
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
 No!

900
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
 No!

901
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
 Tell me about the doctor's office.

902
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,400
 The one where you try to stick the kid with this.

903
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
 Want to tell me?

904
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,400
 No!

905
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,400
 No!

906
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
 She knows you're a driver.

907
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
 Do you know what's left of it?

908
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,400
 Obviously something no conducive to your good health.

909
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
 She's all I needed to know in the first place.

910
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
 Have a good life.

911
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
 What's left of it?

912
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
 No!

913
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
 No!

914
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
 No!

915
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,400
 No!

916
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
 No!

917
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
 No!

918
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
 No!

919
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,400
 No!

920
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,400
 No!

921
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,400
 No!

922
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,400
 No!

923
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,400
 I would post a base, the ransom is still there.

924
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,400
 Nice.

925
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,400
 The ransom still hasn't been picked up.

926
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
 What does that mean?

927
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
 Don't worry, right now it means nothing.

928
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
 What if it's not just a kidnapping?

929
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,400
 I think that if they don't take the ransom, I'm going to get my son back.

930
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,400
 Audrey, don't make this any more complicated than it already is.

931
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
 I'm not making this complicated, Jefferson.

932
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
 It's because of your job.

933
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,400
 What is my job back to do with any of this?

934
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
 It has everything to do with it.

935
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
 Do you understand?

936
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,400
 Because you became famous, we became the targets.

937
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,400
 No matter what any of you all think, the only one who's out there trying to get Jack back is Frank.

938
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,400
 Frank?

939
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
 The chauffeur?

940
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
 You spoke to Frank Martin.

941
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
 The last person who shot Jack alive!

942
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
 We found the boy.

943
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
 Get shut down.

944
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,400
 Hard drive, Blue.

945
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,400
 We're giving him a win in there.

946
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,400
 Yes, sir.

947
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,400
 How long is it going to take?

948
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,400
 The boy is faster than we can.

949
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,400
 He can suffocate in there.

950
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,400
 Stay calm.

951
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,400
 It's my son.

952
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
 Audrey, let them work.

953
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
 Are you just going to sit there and do nothing?

954
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,400
 Audrey!

955
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,400
 They're experts.

956
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,400
 Everyone is an expert.

957
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
 I'm happy with all of you.

958
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
 Let's go.

959
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
 You okay?

960
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,400
 Are you going to the boy?

961
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,400
 Breathe.

962
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,400
 Come on, breathe.

963
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,400
 You're the devil.

964
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,400
 I wish.

965
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,400
 Breathe.

966
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
 Breathe.

967
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
 To me, three.

968
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,400
 You're stupid, didn't you?

969
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,400
 Where is some of it? He's in chamber.

970
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,400
 I need to speak with him. He won't be long.

971
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,400
 I need to speak with him.

972
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,400
 He's in Panasonic.

973
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,400
 He's rapping.

974
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,400
 I'm going to the boy.

975
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,400
 I'm going to the boy.

976
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,400
 I'm going to the boy.

977
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,400
 I'm going to the boy.

978
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
 I'm going to the boy.

979
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,400
 I'm going to the boy.

980
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
 I'm going to the boy.

981
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,400
 I'm going to the boy.

982
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
 I'm going to the boy.

983
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,400
 I'm going to the boy.

984
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,400
 I'm going to the boy.

985
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,400
 I'm going to the boy.

986
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
 I'm going to the boy.

987
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,400
 I'm going to the boy.

988
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,400
 I'm going to the boy.

989
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
 I'm going to the boy.

990
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
 I'm going to the boy.

991
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,400
 I'm going to the boy.

992
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
 I'm going to the boy.

993
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
 I'm going to the boy.

994
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,400
 I'm going to the boy.

995
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
 I'm going to the boy.

996
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
 I'm going to the boy.

997
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
 I'm going to the boy.

998
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,400
 I'm going to the boy.

999
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,400
 I'm going to the boy.

1000
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,400
 I'm going to the boy.

1001
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,400
 I'm going to the boy.

1002
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,400
 Come on, rascal!

1003
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,400
 Come on!

1004
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
 You're going to be a dead man.

1005
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
 What was that?

1006
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,400
 I don't know.

1007
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,400
 What are you doing here?

1008
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
 I need anecdote.

1009
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
 The driver.

1010
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
 He inject me with virus.

1011
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,400
 Walk!

1012
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,400
 Do you meet with where would he get the virus?

1013
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
 The one with less.

1014
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
 I need to find out where he is.

1015
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,840
 Where would he get the virus?

1016
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,360
 The one who left in Dr. Sudjery.

1017
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,360
 Please.

1018
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,360
 I ain't at the point.

1019
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:02,880
 I'm sick.

1020
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,480
 Come down.

1021
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,720
 You're not sick.

1022
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,440
 You have four hours before the virus is active.

1023
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,119
 You know that.

1024
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:11,119
 You weren't on creatin' it.

1025
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:11,720
 Open fridge.

1026
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,559
 I'm telling you.

1027
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:13,880
 Open fridge.

1028
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,000
 Ah!

1029
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,119
 Is the need here?

1030
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:17,200
 Open fridge.

1031
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,039
 Over the fridge.

1032
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,800
 This insurance policy, how many will have two doses?

1033
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,240
 Enough for Tifa than myself.

1034
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,200
 Oh, no!

1035
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,039
 People supposed he canceled.

1036
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:34,440
 There is one for me.

1037
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,680
 And I want it now.

1038
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,840
 Come on.

1039
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,840
 Come on.

1040
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,160
 Let's do it.

1041
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,000
 That's not.

1042
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,840
 What are you?

1043
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,440
 Right.

1044
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,440
 There is enough for two of us.

1045
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,440
 You don't need it.

1046
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,360
 Do you injected me?

1047
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,960
 With water.

1048
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,519
 I'm not sick.

1049
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,720
 Not sick.

1050
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,240
 What?

1051
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,240
 Water.

1052
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,920
 Sort of bitch.

1053
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,760
 Good.

1054
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,960
 A problem is solved.

1055
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,240
 One does for each of us.

1056
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,760
 Not for us.

1057
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,519
 One for you.

1058
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:06,720
 One for the child.

1059
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,440
 You're the version.

1060
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,480
 It's touching.

1061
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,840
 My patience is about to run out.

1062
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,840
 No.

1063
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,200
 Ah!

1064
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:13,880
 Hey!

1065
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,880
 Hey!

1066
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,519
 Tell me about the virus.

1067
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,720
 OK.

1068
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,720
 What you must know.

1069
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,440
 Everything.

1070
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,440
 The start is what is it?

1071
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,519
 It's a recombinant retroimmune double polymorphine

1072
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:25,440
 that you have going to the child will die.

1073
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,599
 Anyone who breathes on with die, then it's over.

1074
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,800
 You mean it, Soma?

1075
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,360
 You know this is designed to go in there after 24 hours.

1076
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,800
 Thanks for the lesson.

1077
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,440
 Now give me the files.

1078
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,000
 You really want to play superhero, don't you?

1079
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,960
 Well, let's see if you can fly.

1080
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,960
 Ah!

1081
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,559
 Hey!

1082
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,679
 You OK?

1083
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:21,039
 OK.

1084
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,960
 There's nothing to worry about.

1085
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,960
 It's just a simple viral infection combined

1086
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,960
 with the stress of what happened.

1087
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,960
 It should pass in a day or two.

1088
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,960
 I gave him something to help him sleep.

1089
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,960
 Call me if anything arises.

1090
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,960
 Thank you.

1091
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,960
 Thank you, Doctor.

1092
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,960
 No.

1093
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,960
 Audrey.

1094
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,960
 I'm sorry, I'm late.

1095
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,960
 I'm going to be late.

1096
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,960
 I'm going to be late.

1097
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,960
 I'm going to be late.

1098
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,960
 I'm going to be late.

1099
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,960
 I'm going to be late.

1100
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
 I'm going to be late.

1101
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,960
 I'm going to be late.

1102
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,960
 I'm going to be late.

1103
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,960
 Audrey, all this is...

1104
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,960
 Well, it's made me realize what a fool I've been.

1105
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,960
 Jack.

1106
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,960
 And with you.

1107
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,960
 Are you okay?

1108
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,960
 Mr. Bill, we're running late.

1109
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,960
 We'll be right out.

1110
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,960
 I'd like to come by after the conference.

1111
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,960
 Check on Jack.

1112
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,960
 Check on you.

1113
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,960
 Check on you.

1114
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,960
 Good.

1115
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,960
 I'll see you soon.

1116
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,960
 They're here if you need them.

1117
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,960
 Are you all right, ma'am?

1118
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,960
 I'm fine.

1119
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,960
 Hello?

1120
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,960
 It's me.

1121
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,960
 You're okay, Mrs. Bill.

1122
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,960
 I got to see you a bit, Dr.

1123
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,960
 Hi, Susan.

1124
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,960
 How are you?

1125
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,960
 I'm alone.

1126
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,960
 Great, Frank.

1127
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,960
 I'm done with.

1128
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,960
 Frank, you were wrong.

1129
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,960
 It was a kid napping.

1130
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,960
 Jack is fine.

1131
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,960
 Jack's been infected with a deadly virus, Audrey.

1132
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,960
 Now anyone who comes into contact with him will die.

1133
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,960
 What are you telling me?

1134
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
 Are you telling me that my son is going to die?

1135
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,960
 No, he's not.

1136
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,960
 I'm not going to die.

1137
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,960
 I'm not going to die.

1138
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
 I'm not going to die.

1139
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,960
 I'm not going to die.

1140
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,960
 I want to think you better the virus becomes airborne.

1141
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,960
 So when you want to breathe down, it gets infected.

1142
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,960
 Some was a weapon.

1143
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,960
 The target is this far.

1144
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,960
 Jefferson?

1145
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,960
 Oh, why?

1146
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,960
 Because of the conference.

1147
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,960
 It's the only logical answer.

1148
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,960
 Drug enforcement agency in the hemisphere in one room.

1149
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,960
 Now, it's been breathed the room dies.

1150
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,960
 Oh, please.

1151
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,960
 You better trust me, Audrey.

1152
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,960
 I'm sorry.

1153
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,960
 I'm sorry.

1154
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,960
 I'm sorry.

1155
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,960
 Can you get to him?

1156
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,960
 What are you going to do?

1157
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,960
 I'm going to go responsible.

1158
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,960
 There's more of this.

1159
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,960
 For you and everybody else.

1160
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,960
 For you now.

1161
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,960
 For you now.

1162
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,960
 We have a guest.

1163
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,960
 He burning up.

1164
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,960
 Okay.

1165
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,960
 You got to go.

1166
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,960
 Go.

1167
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,960
 Don't move!

1168
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,960
 Oh!

1169
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,960
 Oh!

1170
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,960
 Oh!

1171
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
 Oh!

1172
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,960
 Oh!

1173
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,960
 Oh!

1174
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,960
 Oh!

1175
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
 Oh!

1176
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,960
 Oh!

1177
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,960
 Oh!

1178
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,960
 Oh!

1179
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,960
 Oh!

1180
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,960
 Oh!

1181
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,960
 Oh!

1182
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,960
 Oh!

1183
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,960
 Oh!

1184
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,960
 Oh!

1185
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,960
 Oh!

1186
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,960
 Is the governor here?

1187
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,960
 Every fight is going to be here.

1188
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,960
 The governor delegates from all over the world.

1189
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,960
 What's he saying?

1190
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,960
 Hello?

1191
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,960
 You can't go to the conference.

1192
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,960
 Everything all right?

1193
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,960
 To give him a deadly vibe.

1194
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,960
 Audrey, I can't hear you.

1195
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,960
 I'm inside.

1196
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,960
 Now I've got it.

1197
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,960
 I'll see you back.

1198
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
 You all right?

1199
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,960
 All right.

1200
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,960
 Come on.

1201
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,960
 Let's get ready.

1202
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,960
 Come on.

1203
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,960
 I know.

1204
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,960
 You still a guest of the government?

1205
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,960
 No. You gave me the first accommodation.

1206
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,960
 Let me guess.

1207
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,960
 You knew the computer.

1208
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,960
 It's practically my pillow.

1209
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,960
 So?

1210
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,960
 I don't know. I have nothing.

1211
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,960
 My favorite type of investigation.

1212
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,960
 Let's see.

1213
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,960
 Hello.

1214
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,960
 I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to my delegates.

1215
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,960
 Please.

1216
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,960
 That's right.

1217
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,960
 Breathe, my friend.

1218
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,960
 Breathe.

1219
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,960
 Tomorrow, this bus starts around the way

1220
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,960
 and that corporation agreements are dead in buried.

1221
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,960
 You know what your biggest problem is going to be?

1222
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,960
 What?

1223
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,960
 Counting the money.

1224
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,960
 Can't wait for tomorrow.

1225
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,960
 Ah!

1226
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,960
 It's easy, isn't it?

1227
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,960
 Ah!

1228
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,960
 Johnny Chelindee.

1229
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,960
 The highest in South-Houth,

1230
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,960
 21 looking to the trouble.

1231
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,960
 But the repurgates are something that...

1232
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,960
 Someone accessed the database on the 15th floor.

1233
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,960
 That's Gonzalez.

1234
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,960
 He's on vacation.

1235
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,960
 Ah!

1236
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,960
 He was behind the host-stakes of the public ministers in Geneva.

1237
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,960
 It was a nice piece of work.

1238
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,960
 Give me an address.

1239
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,960
 Miami is Thailand.

1240
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,960
 But it can drive number 26.

1241
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,960
 We found the car.

1242
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,960
 One great cup, so call it.

1243
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,960
 Thank you for the compliment.

1244
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,960
 Maybe not.

1245
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,960
 Oh my God, man!

1246
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,960
 Oh!

1247
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,960
 Stop!

1248
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,960
 Send this guy to my car, you're right.

1249
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,960
 I'm coming.

1250
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,960
 I'm coming.

1251
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,960
 I'm coming.

1252
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,960
 Miami.

1253
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,960
 I think I'm better.

1254
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,960
 A little bit.

1255
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,960
 Should I try to go back to sleep?

1256
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,960
 Okay.

1257
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,960
 Man, are you all right?

1258
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,960
 Thanks.

1259
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,960
 Thanks, help me!

1260
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,960
 Oh!

1261
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,960
 Thanks!

1262
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,960
 Thanks!

1263
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,960
 Help me!

1264
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,960
 Oh!

1265
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,960
 Thanks!

1266
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,960
 Thanks!

1267
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,960
 Thanks!

1268
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,960
 Oh!

1269
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,960
 Oh!

1270
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,960
 Oh!

1271
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,960
 Oh!

1272
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,960
 Oh!

1273
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,960
 Oh!

1274
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,960
 Oh!

1275
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,960
 Oh!

1276
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,960
 Oh!

1277
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,960
 Oh!

1278
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,960
 Oh!

1279
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,960
 Oh!

1280
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,960
 Oh!

1281
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,960
 Oh!

1282
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,960
 Oh!

1283
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,960
 Oh!

1284
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,960
 Oh!

1285
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,960
 Oh!

1286
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,960
 Oh!

1287
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,960
 Oh!

1288
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,960
 Oh!

1289
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,960
 Oh!

1290
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,960
 Oh!

1291
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,960
 Oh!

1292
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,960
 Oh!

1293
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,960
 Oh!

1294
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,960
 Oh!

1295
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,960
 Oh!

1296
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,960
 Oh!

1297
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,960
 Oh!

1298
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,960
 Oh!

1299
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,960
 Okay, do it.

1300
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,960
 What are you doing?

1301
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,960
 You know last night got me thinking.

1302
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,960
 How do you transport the antidote safely?

1303
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,960
 We need something that won't break.

1304
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,960
 Something that can't be stolen.

1305
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,960
 Something totally secure.

1306
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,960
 But it's good to have a good time.

1307
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,960
 If we don't have a good time, we'd be late.

1308
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,960
 But we'll be late.

1309
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,960
 We'll be late.

1310
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,960
 Okay, let's go.

1311
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,960
 I can't be stolen. Something totally secure.

1312
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:25,960
 Me?

1313
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:33,960
 Impressive.

1314
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,460
 Get dressed.

1315
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:38,460
 Stop it.

1316
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,460
 Is this your friends?

1317
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,960
 Not yet.

1318
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,960
 Where'd they go?

1319
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,960
 The garage.

1320
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,960
 I'm out of ammo.

1321
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,960
 Me too.

1322
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,960
 So am I. Where are the reloads?

1323
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,960
 The garage.

1324
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,960
 Check now! Go, go, go!

1325
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,960
 Ah!

1326
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,960
 Ah!

1327
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,960
 Ah!

1328
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,960
 Ah!

1329
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,960
 What do you want me to do?

1330
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,960
 Keep the made of running.

1331
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:53,960
 What?

1332
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:55,960
 Don't worry baby.

1333
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,960
 It's safe now. It's safe.

1334
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,960
 You're so beautiful.

1335
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,960
 Remind me of my yellow poop rider.

1336
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,960
 Ah!

1337
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,960
 Ah!

1338
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:52,960
 Ah!

1339
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,960
 Don't move.

1340
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,960
 Oh, Mr. Driver.

1341
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,960
 Where are you in tomorrow?

1342
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,960
 But then I believe what you came for all over the floor

1343
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,960
 he wouldn't want this for you.

1344
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,960
 Not after you walked so hard try to get to the antidote.

1345
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,960
 Take a good look, Freddie Martin.

1346
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,960
 I'm a cure for what aids you.

1347
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,960
 I'm the only cure for what aids you.

1348
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,960
 I am the antidote.

1349
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,960
 When I was dry I'm impressed.

1350
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,960
 Didn't give you enough credit to come to the driver

1351
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,960
 to figure this out.

1352
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,960
 I'm figured it all out yet.

1353
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,960
 Perhaps I can help you. What part are you leaving with how you say it?

1354
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,960
 Think of you.

1355
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,960
 Why?

1356
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,960
 Oh, that's the easy part.

1357
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,960
 It's a business that you're pure and simple.

1358
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,960
 I'm for hire to the highest bidder.

1359
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,960
 And in this case the highest bidder was the Colombian cocaine cartels

1360
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,960
 that wanted this pesky lumen afterbacks.

1361
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,960
 You really think killing all these politicians

1362
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,960
 is going to make things easier for them?

1363
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,960
 That's not my problem.

1364
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,960
 I'm sorry to do a job.

1365
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,960
 I did the job.

1366
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,960
 Like you just did.

1367
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,960
 My pay is better.

1368
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,960
 My hair and my suit too.

1369
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,960
 Oh, Lola.

1370
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,960
 Now if you'll excuse me, I have a plan to catch you.

1371
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,960
 Okay, name it.

1372
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,960
 Charge out.

1373
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,960
 Don't have Blake.

1374
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:46,960
 Pleasure.

1375
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,960
 You're killing me.

1376
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,960
 Hey!

1377
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1378
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1379
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1380
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1381
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1382
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1383
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1384
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1385
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1386
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1387
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1388
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1389
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1390
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1391
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,960
 I'm going to kill you.

1392
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,960
 We're coming to you right from the Keyviscan Car's way.

1393
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,960
 At least 10 for these cars.

1394
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,960
 I'm in heart for sheet of the stolen red picket truck.

1395
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,960
 Aright, this is just not.

1396
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,359
 It's just not Jim, are you getting that?

1397
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,960
 There's another car that is swaying past the police

1398
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,960
 as if there was standing still.

1399
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:48,960
 Looks like...

1400
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,960
 So Mitch can drive.

1401
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,960
 How much on this one?

1402
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:51,960
 Yes, he can.

1403
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:37,159
 BraWhite

1404
01:13:37,159 --> 01:13:44,159
 If clearance for take up Mr. Chilini, sit back and enjoy your flight and we will be in Columbia before you know it.

1405
01:14:07,159 --> 01:14:09,159
 I'm going to be in the air.

1406
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,159
 There will be a problem with the landing gear.

1407
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,159
 We won't come back to land.

1408
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:35,159
 We fly with a problem.

1409
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:37,159
 Theoretically, then you land where we get to Columbia.

1410
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:41,159
 Once if you can lift the menu.

1411
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:45,159
 Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Chilini. I don't know where you're going.

1412
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,159
 Sorry. Flight's been cancelled.

1413
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:56,159
 I'm sorry to inform you that you have been cancelled.

1414
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,159
 Never see it.

1415
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:02,159
 Relax.

1416
01:15:03,159 --> 01:15:04,159
 It's a dream.

1417
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:06,159
 Let's get to know each other.

1418
01:15:07,159 --> 01:15:09,159
 I think I know everything I need to know.

1419
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,159
 I'm sorry.

1420
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:04,159
 I'm sorry.

1421
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:34,159
 I'm sorry.

1422
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,159
 I'm sorry.

1423
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,159
 I'm sorry.

1424
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,159
 I'm sorry.

1425
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:34,159
 I'm sorry.

1426
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,159
 Five points.

1427
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:42,159
 What has eyes but no ears, skin but no hair.

1428
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:45,159
 It's white inside and brown outside.

1429
01:18:45,159 --> 01:18:46,159
 Mom?

1430
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:48,159
 Wrong.

1431
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,159
 Dad?

1432
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,159
 The catapult.

1433
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,159
 Wrong.

1434
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,159
 A potato.

1435
01:18:58,159 --> 01:18:59,159
 May I help you?

1436
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:01,159
 I was just leaving.

1437
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:02,159
 You'll be out of here.

1438
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,159
 Wrong.

1439
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,159
 Snake.

1440
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,159
 Wrong.

1441
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:11,159
 A peanut.

1442
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:13,159
 Yeah.

1443
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:14,159
 A hot dog.

1444
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,159
 Wrong.

1445
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:30,159
 That was best.

1446
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,159
 Yeah.

1447
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,159
 Didn't want you to miss your plane.

1448
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,159
 That's very thoughtful of you.

1449
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,159
 Five points.

1450
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:47,159
 Check it off the bus.

1451
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:53,159
 You will believe I have to meet us like that.

1452
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,159
 I have something for you.

1453
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:03,159
 You figure since you never got to the beach.

1454
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:08,159
 I know water, water, sandy sand, ears, it's all the same.

1455
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:11,159
 I have one like two or six nights in Paris.

1456
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:12,159
 Thank you Frank.

1457
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:14,159
 It was an interesting vacation.

1458
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,159
 What more could one ask for?

1459
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,159
 Yeah.

1460
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:19,159
 A laugh on it.

1461
01:20:19,159 --> 01:20:21,159
 A laugh on my friend.

1462
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:22,159
 Have a good flight.

1463
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:23,159
 I doubt it.

1464
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:25,159
 So I said it's all that wins.

1465
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:28,159
 I guess we can have everything we wish for it, can we?

1466
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,159
 No, we can't.

1467
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:48,159
 Yeah.

1468
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:51,159
 I'm looking for a transporter.

1469
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:56,159
 I'm listening.

1470
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:02,159
 I'm listening.

1471
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:03,159

 I'm listening.

1473
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,159
 I'm listening.

1474
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:06,159
 I'm listening.

1475
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:07,159
 I'm listening.

1476
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:08,159
 I'm listening.

1477
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:09,159
 I'm listening.

1478
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:10,159
 I'm listening.

1479
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:11,159
 I'm listening.

1480
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:12,159
 I'm listening.

1481
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,159
 I'm listening.

1482
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:14,159
 I'm listening.

1483
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,159
 I'm listening.

1484
01:21:15,159 --> 01:21:16,159
 I'm listening.

1485
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,159
 I'm listening.

1486
01:21:17,159 --> 01:21:18,159
 I'm listening.

1487
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,159
 I'm listening.

1488
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:20,159
 I'm listening.

1489
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,159
 I'm listening.

1490
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:22,159

 This is me talking to you some reason.

1682
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:37,159
 Hey!

01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:38,159
 Hey.

01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,159
 Hey.

1685
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:40,159

01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,159
 Hey!

1687
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,159
 You're sitting here.

1688
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,159
 Calm down.

1689
01:24:43,159 --> 01:24:44,159
 Chill!

1690
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,159

1694
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:49,159
 Stay calm, Fu.

1695
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:54,159
 I don't want to stay, I'm super far not, man, I don't want to break

1696
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:58,159
 So give it up baby, you're not in control

1697
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:02,159
 Don't let the sun rise till your soul

1698
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:06,159
 You say no, I'm not a mess, it's really un-bestaid

 Just let it on and rock, let it win and rock

1701
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:19,159
 Don't let the sun rise till your soul

1702

01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:24,159
 I'm the ground, something made me fall

1713
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:31,159
 I'm the second, the dark, the light down

1714

 Someone made me fall in the city of San Luis

1715
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:41,159
 Don't let the sun rise till your soul

1716
