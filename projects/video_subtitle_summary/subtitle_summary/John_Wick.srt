00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:39,771
<i>It looks like the storm has passed.</i>

3
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,607
<i>New Yorkers, a season high,
seven inches of rain last night.</i>

4
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,809
<i>High winds and flooding in some areas</i>

5
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,911
<i>even left some New Yorkers stranded.</i>

6
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,480
<i>City crews still working this morning.</i>

7
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,714
<i>They're trying to restore power</i>

8
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,552
<i>Good news is, today should be
sunny with highs in the low 60s.</i>

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,058
<i>Relentless weather
these past few weeks.</i>

10
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,793
<i>So get out there, enjoy the sun,</i>

11
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,661
<i>go to the park, get outside if you can,</i>

12
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,230
<i>because it's not gonna last long.</i>

13
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:42,734
<i>- What are you doing, John?
- Looking at you.</i>

14
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,236
<i>Come here.</i>

15
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:54,077
<i>Are you still filming?</i>

16
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,205
<i>Just an anniversary...</i>

17
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,734
It's been a while.

18
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:05,737
My condolences.

19
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,741
How're you holdin' up?

20
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,509
I keep asking "Why her?"

21
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:16,414
There's no rhyme or reason to this life.

22
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,450
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.

23
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,453
Are you sure?

24
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,155
Don't blame yourself.

25
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,494
What are you really doing here, Marcus?

26
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:35,333
Just checkin' up on an old friend.

27
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,175
Goodbye, John.

28
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,975
John Wick?

29
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,243
Yes.

30
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,545
Sign here, please.

31
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,821
And the pen.

32
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,190
Sorry.

33
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,091
Here you go. Good night.
Thanks.

I can't be there for you.</i>

someone, to love.</i>

<i>"Until that day,
your best friend, Helen."</i>

41
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,551
Hey.

42
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,256
Hey.

43
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,596
Daisy.

44
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:21,465
Of course.

45
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,505
Hey.

46
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,412
Come on.

47
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:02,306
I'm up. I'm up...

48
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,742
I'm up. I'm up.

49
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,095
Hey!

50
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,231
Oh.

51
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,599
Right.

52
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
What?

53
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,626
We'll grab you some kibble later.

54
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,093

55

_

56
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,383
Nice ride.

57
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,454
Mustang.

58
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,655
Boss 429.

59
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:35,893
- She a '70?
- '69.

60
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,495
Huh.

61
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,397
- Beautiful car.
- Thanks.

62
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:46,303
- How much?
- Excuse me?

63
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:50,274
- How much for the car?
- She's not for sale.

64
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,479
Oh, I love dogs.

65
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,480

66
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,850
_

67
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,527
You have good day, sir.

68
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,318
All right, come on, then.

69
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:46,924
How you doin'?

70
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:00,671
You need to go?

71
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,298
_

72
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:33,404

74
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:50,721
Uh-huh.

75
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,467
_

76
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,466
_

77
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,106
Yo, Aurelio!

78
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,608
Ah?

79
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,178
I want a new VIN number
and some clean papers.

80
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,214
Where'd you get that car?

81
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:51,201
Is it here?

82
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:03,614
It was.

83
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,950
I asked you where
the hell did you get it?

84
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,154
<i>AURELIO:
Iosef Tarasov nicked it.</i>

85
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,257
Viggo's son.

86
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:16,994
Yeah.

87
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,132
All right, get out of here. Just get
out of my shop. Get out right now.

88
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,800
Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio?

89
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,203
Because we own you.

90
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,877
What did you say?
What did you say to me?

91
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,245
We own you.

92
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:38,682
You don't own me, punk.

93
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,584
I work with your father, all right?

94
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,955
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?

95
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,623
No.

96
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,026
I sure as hell fucked up his dog.

97
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,227
You fucked up his dog?
That's what you did?

98
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,063
- You fucked up his dog?
- Yeah...

99
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,898
That's crazy shit, man.

100
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,205
Aw, look at you.
That's great.

101
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,775
You're gonna come into my shop
and you're gonna pull a gun on me.

102
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,110
Ah, that's great, man.
Come on!

103
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,713
Now, either you kill me right now

104
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,049
or you get the fuck outta my shop!

105
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:17,721
Viggo is not gonna like this.

106
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,691
How do you know what Viggo
likes or doesn't like?

107
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,292
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.

108
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:28,799
You've got a fuckin'
pair on you, old man!

109
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,304
I guess we'll be takin'
our business someplace else.

110
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:39,643
<i>So what are you gonna do?</i>

111
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,657
I need a ride.

112
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:09,640
Aurelio speaking.

113
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,111
I heard you struck my son.

114
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,647
<i>Yes sir, I did.</i>

115
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,348
And may I ask why?

116
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,952
Yeah. Well, because he stole
John Wick's car, sir.

117
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,188
And, uh, killed his dog.

118
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,428
Oh.

119
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:02,859
Viggo?

120
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,294
Yeah?

121
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,930
They've agreed to your terms.

122
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,165
I mean, it's not like you gave them much

123
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,100
of a choice anyway, though, right?

124
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,271
Congratulations.

125
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:19,042
Sir?

126
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,113
Have you seen my son?

127
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:42,866
How was your trip, kid?

128
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,202
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.

129
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,770
Or ever.

130
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,363
That's a nice jacket.

131
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,364
Thanks.
Yeah.

132
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,337
_

133
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,210
Should I go?

134
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,512
_

135
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,049
Viggo, English, please.
Come on...

136
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,152
Stay, God damn it!

137
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,453
What did I do?
_

138
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:41,057
We did what you asked.

139
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,959
No one saw shit.

140
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:49,299
I'm not talking about Atlantic City.

141
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,369
What, then?

142
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,505
You mean Aurelio's?
So I stole a fucking car!

143
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,073
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

144
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,308
- Right, I'll go...
- You stay!

145
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,300
It's not what you did, son,
that angers me so.

146
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:25,302
It's who you did it to.

147
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,871
Who?
The fucking nobody!

148
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,011
That fuckin' nobody is John Wick.

149
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,596
<i>He once was an associate of ours.</i>

150
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,000
They call him Baba Yaga.

151
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,872
The Boogeyman?

152
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:03,607
Well, John wasn't exactly
The Boogeyman.

153
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,648
He was the one you sent to
kill the fucking Boogeyman.

154
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:17,454
Oh.

155
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,023
John is a man of focus,

156
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,394
commitment,
sheer will.

157
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:28,431
Something you know
very little about.

158
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:33,069
I once saw him kill
three men in a bar.

159
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:35,372
With a pencil.

160
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,208
With a fuckin'...

161
00:24:41,178 --> 00:24:42,612
...pencil.

162
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:53,690
Then suddenly one day
he asked to leave.

163
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:57,327
It's over a woman, of course.

164
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:05,168
<i> So I made a deal with him.</i>

165
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,273
I gave him an impossible task.

166
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:14,644
A job no one could have pulled off.

167
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,653
The bodies he buried that day

168
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:27,691
laid the foundation of what we are now.

169
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:34,197
And then, my son,

170
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,667
a few days after his wife died,

171
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,403
you steal his car

172
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:45,141
and kill his fuckin' dog.

173
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,443
Father, I can make this right.

174
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,545
Oh...

175
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,513
How do you plan that?

176
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,582
- By finishing what I started.
- What the...

177
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,484
Did he hear a fucking word I said?
_

178
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:59,322
Iosef! Iosef! Listen!

179
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:02,726
Huh?

180
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,661
John will come for you.

181
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,435
<i> And you will do nothing,</i>

182
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,504
because you can do nothing.

183
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,040
So get the fuck out of my sight!

184
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:47,570
<i>Hello, John.</i>

185
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,276
I heard about your wife,
and I'm sorry.

186
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,377
My condolences.

187
00:26:57,314 --> 00:27:01,651
<i> It seems to be fate,
or happenstance</i>

188
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,422
<i>or just bad fuckin' luck caused
our paths to cross once again.</i>

189
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:11,394
John?

190
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,369
Let us not resort to our baser instincts

191
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,372
<i>and handle this like
civilized men, to move on...</i>

192
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:35,418
What'd he say?

193
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,489
Enough.

194
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,590
Oh, God.

195
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,296
Task your crew.

196
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,632
How many?

197
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,101
How many do you have?

198
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:04,887
- Evenin', John.
- Evenin', Jimmy.

199
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,356
Noise complaint?

200
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:09,992
Noise complaint.

201
00:32:20,804 --> 00:32:22,572
You, uh, workin' again?

202
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,140
No, just sortin' some stuff out.

203
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,377
Ah, well...

204
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,647
I'll leave you be, then.

205
00:32:32,716 --> 00:32:34,984
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Jimmy.

206
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:53,403
This is Wick.

207
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,772
Yes, John Wick, that's right.

208
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,408
I'd like to make
a dinner reservation for 12.

209
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:18,761
Good to see you, John.

210
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:20,797
Charlie.

211
00:33:33,577 --> 00:33:34,744
You look good.

212
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,948
And here I'd feared
you'd left all this behind.

213
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:22,792
Will I be hearin'
from you anytime soon?

214
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,262
Goodbye, Charlie.

215
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,198
John.

216
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,204
Of course he did.

217
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:39,509
Put a contract on John Wick.

218
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:42,178
- How much?
- Two million.

219
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:45,047
_

220
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,954
English, Viggo, please.

221
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:59,695
Put Iosef in the Red Circle and wait.

222
00:35:01,698 --> 00:35:03,099
For what?

223
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,268
For John Wick, of course.

224
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,761
Thank you.

225
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:36,132
To what do I owe this visit?

226
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,104
I have a job for you.

227
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:45,007
And I've got a phone.

228
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,276
Hmm.

229
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,846
I want to offer you
this face to face

230
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,849
seeing as how you
might find it personal.

231
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:58,721
Would you kill John Wick
for two million dollars?

232
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,027
After all, you were close.

233
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,798
Is the contract exclusive?

234
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,600
No, it's open.

235
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,768
It's a timely matter,
it has to be handled quickly.

236
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,338
Consider it done.

237
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:19,342
Thank you, Marcus.

238
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,711
I know I can trust you.
Thanks for the drink.

239
00:38:26,236 --> 00:38:28,904
Room 918.
Do enjoy your stay.

240
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,306
Thanks.

241
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,009
Good seeing you again, John.

242
00:38:35,011 --> 00:38:36,178
Perkins.

243
00:38:39,015 --> 00:38:41,317
I have you for two nights.

244
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,452
Depending on business, it may be more.

245
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,121
Of course, sir.

246
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,056
So when did the old
place get a facelift?

247
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:50,126
Around four years ago.

248
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,129
But I assure you, sir, she
really hasn't changed much.

249
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,330
Same owner?

250
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,898
Same owner.

251
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,207
Room 818.

252
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:09,845
And, as always,

253
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:14,483
it is a pleasure having
you with us again, Mr. Wick.

254
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:34,136
<i>- What are you doing, John?
- Looking at you.</i>

255
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:36,505
<i> Come here.</i>

256
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,233
Hello, Winston.

257
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:14,937
Jonathan.

258
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:21,377
Now, as I recall,
weren't you the one tasked to dole out

259
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:23,479
the beatings, not receive them?

260
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,980
Rusty, I guess.

261
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:27,683
To what do we owe the pleasure?

262
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:31,287
Iosef Tarasov.

263
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:33,956
What about him?

264
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,157
I'd like to talk with him.

265
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,161
A talk, you say.

266
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,233
I'm familiar with
the parlance, Jonathan.

267
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:47,703
I want to ask you this.

268
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,571
Have you returned to the fold?

269
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,342
Just visiting.

270
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,444
Have you thought this through?

271
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:59,248
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

272
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,152
You got out once.

273
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,654
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond,

274
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,993
you may well find
something reaches out

275
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,362
and drags you back into its depths.

276
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,630
Where do I find him?

277
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:18,534
Hey.

278
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:21,170
Wick's at The Continental.

279
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:26,542
Welcome home, John.

280
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,077
We have a contact there who's
willing to take him out for us.

281
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,112
Yeah?

282
00:42:31,314 --> 00:42:32,982
How brazen.

283
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:38,087
If they're willing to break
the rules of Continental,

284
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,655
double the bounty.

285
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,191
You know the rules.

286
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,293
No business can be
conducted on these premises

287
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,730
lest incurring heavy penalties.

288
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,401
Have a drink

289
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:56,105
and relax.

290
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,541
For now.

291
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:05,347
It's personal.

292
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:14,256
Holy shit! Jonathan!

293
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,525
Hey, Addy.
My God!

294
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,395
How long has it been?
Four years?

295
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,030
Five and change.

296
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:24,466
So tell me, how was life
on the other side?

297
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,468
It was good, Addy.

298
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,303
Far better than I deserved.

299
00:43:29,706 --> 00:43:31,407
Hey, I'm sorry
to hear about your...

300
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,508
Thanks.

301
00:43:34,711 --> 00:43:36,412
I've never seen you like this.

302
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:38,480
Like what?

303
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,083
Vulnerable.

304
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:45,154
I'm retired.

305
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,089
Not if you're drinkin' here,
you're not.

306
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:50,692
- Usual?
- Please.

307
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,070
- Compliments of the house.
- Thanks.

308
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,120
_

309
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,733
Did you see the tits on that girl?

310
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,805
Better hope Lita is working tonight.

311
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,947
_

312
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,957
Are you scared of
the fuckin' boogeyman?

313
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,758
I'm not.

314
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,795
No. But you should be.

315
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,301
I want another bottle!

316
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:50,539
Right fuckin' now!
Go get me a bottle!

317
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,008
Come on!

318
00:47:01,584 --> 00:47:02,951
Hello, Francis.

319
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,420
Mr. Wick.
_

320
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:15,297
Are you here on business, sir?

321
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,833
Afraid so, Francis.

322
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:20,569
Why don't you take the night off.

323
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,010
Thank you, sir.

324
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:57,339
_

325
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:00,642
Fuck you, motherfucker!

326
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:09,451
Where is Iosef?

327
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:14,756
Bath house, downstairs.

328
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:15,924
_

329
00:49:12,648 --> 00:49:13,648
_

330
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,169
_

331
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,881
Go!

332
00:51:08,264 --> 00:51:09,531
_

333
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:29,150
John Wick's there.
Go get him!

334
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:45,133
_

335
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:52,641
Move! He's here! He's fucking here!
He's there! He's coming!

336
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:34,643
Get in! Get in!

337
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:36,811
Come on, come on!

338
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:53,955
_

339
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:24,519
- Good evening, Mr. Wick.
- Good evening.

340
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,422
- How may I be of service?
- Is the doctor in?

341
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,290
Yes, sir. 24/7.

342
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,292
- Then send him up, please.
- Yes, sir.

343
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,794
How good's your laundry?

344
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,265
I'm sorry to say that
no one's that good.

345
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:41,102
No. I thought not.

346
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:44,005
May I suggest a drink, sir.

347
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,206
Bourbon, perhaps.

348
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:48,376
That sounds perfect.

349
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:05,493
So what sort of movement
am I looking at?

350
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:08,229
Well, if you're lookin' to heal,

351
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,531
then keep it marginal.

352
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:14,068
However, if you still have...

353
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,570
...business to attend to,

354
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:20,508
take two of these beforehand.

355
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,813
Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed,

356
00:56:25,948 --> 00:56:28,850
but you'll have full function.

357
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,418
Do you need anything for the pain?

358
00:56:32,154 --> 00:56:33,888
No, I've got that covered.

359
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:42,257
Hey, John.

360
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,995
Perkins?

361
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:47,996
I thought I'd let myself in.

362
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:51,032
I noticed.

363
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:02,043
I never knew Ms. Perkins to get
out of bed for less than three.

364
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:04,012
Viggo's giving me four
to break hotel rules.

365
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:05,580
That's unwise, I assure you.

366
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:14,188
You were always a pussy.

367
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:32,166
Yes?

368
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:34,335
<i>I apologize for
calling you at this hour,</i>

369
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,472
but we have received
a number of grievances

370
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:39,374
from your floor concerning the noise.

371
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:43,311
My apologies.

372
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:47,348
I was dealing with an uninvited guest.

373
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,417
Have you need then of, say,

374
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,552
a dinner reservation, perhaps?

375
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:54,255
Perhaps.
I'll have to get back to you.

376
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,131
No!

377
01:00:04,533 --> 01:00:06,234
Where's Iosef?

378
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,301
Fuck you.

379
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,369
Where's Viggo?

380
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,671
I'm not telling you shit!

381
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:13,141
Do you really wanna die here, Perkins?

382
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,310
Give me somethin'.

383
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,383
Little Russia.

384
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,520
There's a church near Cannon Court.

385
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:28,289
<i>- What about it?
- It's a front.</i>

386
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,757
It's where Viggo keeps
his private stash.

387
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:33,494
Thank you.

388
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:42,103
Do I know you?

389
01:00:43,672 --> 01:00:45,306
I'm thinkin' so.

390
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:54,315
Hey, John.

391
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,217
Hey, Harry.

392
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,652
Everything all right?

393
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,588
Yeah. Everything's fine.

394
01:01:01,723 --> 01:01:03,524
I'll leave you to it, then.

395
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:04,592
Hey, Harry?

396
01:01:06,261 --> 01:01:08,362
You keen on earning a coin?

397
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:09,831
Babysittin' the sleepin' one?

398
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,299
Catch and release?

399
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:12,533
Catch and release.

400
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:46,400
My son, how might I help you?

401
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:54,242
Motherfucker!
_

402
01:02:05,387 --> 01:02:07,488
Let's go to the vault.

403
01:02:18,934 --> 01:02:19,934
Open it.
_

404
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:28,643
Viggo will kill me.

405
01:02:33,582 --> 01:02:34,582
Uh-huh.

406
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:47,795
Ladies, out.

407
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:52,833
_

408
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,910
Honestly,

409
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,379
what do you think you're
going to do with all of that?

410
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:06,948
This.

411
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:37,845
_

412
01:03:55,597 --> 01:03:58,366
Don't worry.

413
01:03:58,368 --> 01:03:59,734
Housekeeping will find you.

414
01:04:01,036 --> 01:04:03,037
Treat all your ladies like this?

415
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,940
You are no lady.
Trust me.

416
01:04:12,914 --> 01:04:14,615
Harry, is it?

417
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,620
How'd you like to earn
more than just a gold coin?

418
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:24,625
You've broken the rules.

419
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:28,796
You've done business
on Continental grounds.

420
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:32,933
And management does not take
kindly to that sort of behavior.

421
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:36,070
Fuck management.

422
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,713
Don't worry.
Housekeeping will find you.

423
01:04:49,751 --> 01:04:50,751
_

424
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:54,322
Ashes to ashes.

425
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,091
Can we recover from this?

426
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,659
Viggo, you know what
was in that vault, right?

427
01:04:58,661 --> 01:04:59,960
It was nothing.

428
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:05,599
Shit!

429
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:23,918
Come on!

430
01:05:27,389 --> 01:05:28,389
_

431
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:44,632
I'll say this, John.

432
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:47,201
They sure as fuck
broke the mold with you.

433
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,106
Ay, ay...

434
01:07:01,116 --> 01:07:03,551
You always had a certain...

435
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:06,854
...audacity about you, you know.

436
01:07:07,889 --> 01:07:10,057
Right?
Oh, yeah.

437
01:07:13,728 --> 01:07:18,098
I can say you're still very
much the John Wick of old.

438
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,201
Am I?

439
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:26,907
People don't change.
You know that.

440
01:07:27,976 --> 01:07:29,710
Times, they do.

441
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:37,051
Do you know what was in that vault?

442
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,186
Artwork, cash, not without its worth,

443
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:41,922
but the leverage I had on this city,

444
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:45,860
audio recordings, physical
evidence, blackmail,

445
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:47,194
it was fuckin' priceless!

446
01:07:48,196 --> 01:07:49,730
Priceless!

447
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:56,070
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.

448
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,073
Yeah, I know you did.

449
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,140
Yeah.

450
01:08:01,176 --> 01:08:02,576
Are you really laughing?

451
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:10,951
So...

452
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:17,157
Then you got married, ah?
Settled down.

453
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,827
How did you manage that anyways?

454
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:22,263
Luck, I guess.

455
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,733
Yeah.

456
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:28,769
Yeah, while you had
your wife, I had my son.

457
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,839
And believe me,
you had a far better deal.

458
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:39,113
And then you left.

459
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,248
And the way you got out,

460
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:46,720
lying to yourself that the past
held no sway over the future.

461
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,322
But in the end,

462
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:54,962
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds,

463
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,699
which is why God took your wife

464
01:09:00,268 --> 01:09:02,703
and unleashed you upon me.

465
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:08,809
This life follows you.

466
01:09:11,012 --> 01:09:13,714
It clings to you,

467
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:19,053
infecting everyone
who comes close to you.

468
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:21,855
We are cursed, you and I.

469
01:09:23,224 --> 01:09:26,360
On that we agree.

470
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:32,366
Finally, common ground.

471
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:35,035
Okay.

472
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,304
Step aside.

473
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,239
Give me your son.

474
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,875
John Wick.

475
01:09:45,046 --> 01:09:46,046
_

476
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:51,885
It was just a fucking car!
Just a fuckin' dog!

477
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:53,320
Just a dog...

478
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:55,723
Viggo?

479
01:09:57,325 --> 01:09:58,759
Yeah.

480
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,995
When Helen died, I lost everything.

481
01:10:02,664 --> 01:10:05,833
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep.

482
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:09,069
A final gift from my wife.

483
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,239
In that moment, I received
some semblance of hope.

484
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:17,311
An opportunity to grieve unalone.

485
01:10:19,347 --> 01:10:21,015
And your son

486
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,917
took that from me!

487
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:24,985
Oh, come on...

488
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,021
Stole that from me!

489
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:29,990
Killed that from me!

490
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,726
People keep asking if I'm back.

491
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:35,329
And I haven't really had an answer.

492
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:39,033
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back!

493
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:42,136
So you can either hand over
your son... _

494
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:45,806
...or you can die
screaming alongside him!

495
01:13:22,964 --> 01:13:24,498
Cool it, cool it, cool it,
cool it, cool it!

496
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,867
John!

497
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:30,604
- Where is he?
- Shit.

498
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:33,907
Shit!

499
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,415
I have your word that
if I tell you where he is,

500
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,250
you'll let me walk away?

501
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,484
Pull the contract.

502
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,224
Done.

503
01:13:55,363 --> 01:13:58,065
He's kept in a safe house.
Brooklyn.

504
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,933
434 Wallace Place.

505
01:14:02,503 --> 01:14:06,106
- They know you're coming.
- Of course.

506
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,507
But it won't matter.

507
01:14:19,921 --> 01:14:20,921
_

508
01:14:59,594 --> 01:15:01,228
Will you stop playing
the fucking video game?

509
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,298
_

510
01:15:09,437 --> 01:15:10,504
_

511
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:18,111
Will you stop playing
that fucking video game?

512
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:30,557
Get down, get down!

513
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:42,402
Come on, come on!
Get down, get down!

514
01:16:33,321 --> 01:16:34,321
_

515
01:17:01,582 --> 01:17:02,749
Make the arrangements.

516
01:17:21,302 --> 01:17:22,302
Thank you.

517
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:24,771
Our pleasure, sir.

518
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:32,179
A parting gift.
From the management.

519
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:34,381
Compensation for last
night's unfortunate

520
01:17:35,483 --> 01:17:36,483
incident.

521
01:18:24,532 --> 01:18:27,534
How many times
do I have to save your ass?

522
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,637
- I appreciate it.
- Of course.

523
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:31,671
You look terrible.

524
01:18:32,673 --> 01:18:34,508
No, I look retired.

525
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,176
Retired?

526
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:37,611
You really believe that?

527
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,627
You made a new life.

528
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:57,497
You'll find your way back to it.

529
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,234
It's time to go home.

530
01:19:54,989 --> 01:19:58,825
Let's get on with this,
whatever the fuck this is.

531
01:19:58,827 --> 01:19:59,960
Hello, Marcus.

532
01:20:13,574 --> 01:20:14,674
This is John.

533
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:19,312
I appreciate you granting
my son a swift death.

534
01:20:21,749 --> 01:20:24,484
<i>I wouldn't know how to
reply to that either.</i>

535
01:20:26,487 --> 01:20:28,622
Marcus betrayed me.

536
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:41,835
You pulled the contract.

537
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:46,606
And while it was open,
you had every chance,

538
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:49,876
every opportunity to kill John Wick.

539
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:52,979
And if you had done your job,

540
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:55,282
my son would be still alive!

541
01:20:57,985 --> 01:20:59,819
<i> And in so doing,</i>

542
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,988
he broke the cardinal rule.

543
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:05,025
Thank you.

544
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:09,963
Ms. Perkins.

545
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:13,967
Why am I not surprised?

546
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:16,069
In for a penny, in for a pound.

547
01:21:17,738 --> 01:21:20,974
<i>So, John, I had no choice.</i>

548
01:21:21,976 --> 01:21:24,344
I always liked you, Marcus.

549
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,881
The last of the old guard.

550
01:21:32,486 --> 01:21:33,586
Oh.

551
01:21:36,624 --> 01:21:40,627
But unlike the others,
you go out on my terms.

552
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:43,463
God! No!

553
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:47,834
No, my good sir.

554
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,471
I go out on my own.

555
01:22:13,427 --> 01:22:14,427
See?

556
01:22:26,073 --> 01:22:27,640
Well played, old friend.

557
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,816
We done, Viggo?

558
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,485
We're done.

559
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:39,486
Okay. Here.

560
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:41,721
Thank you.

561
01:22:44,925 --> 01:22:47,160
Yeah. Fuel the chopper.

562
01:23:10,184 --> 01:23:14,154
<i>Ms. Perkins, I apologize
for calling you at this hour.</i>

563
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:59,766
Ms. Perkins,

564
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:01,935
your membership to the
Continental has been,

565
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:04,704
by thine own hand, revoked.

566
01:24:31,932 --> 01:24:34,267
<i>I know what
you're thinking, Jonathan.</i>

567
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:36,169
<i> We live by a code.</i>

568
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:37,871
Which is why I'm not
the one telling you that

569
01:24:37,873 --> 01:24:39,873
a certain helicopter
at a certain helipad

570
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:42,208
is being fueled for a certain someone.

571
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,595
Have you got my cigarettes?

572
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:03,696
Yeah, I got your cigarettes.

573
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:25,051
_

574
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:28,655
Oh, fuck!

575
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,927
Yeah. Super.
Come on, let's go. Faster!

576
01:25:33,929 --> 01:25:35,728
The helicopter's right down
there. Come on! Let's go!

577
01:25:49,143 --> 01:25:50,243
Oh, shit!

578
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:52,312
Goddamn, I knew he'd come.

579
01:26:06,827 --> 01:26:09,028
What's fuckin' wrong with this guy?

580
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:10,730
Somebody give me a gun.
Who's got a gun?

581
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,367
Oh, God!

582
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:18,071
That was a good one.

583
01:26:18,073 --> 01:26:19,072
Who's got a gun?

584
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:36,289
Fuck!

585
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:55,875
Viggo, the helicopters, right over
there. We have to get over there.

586
01:27:06,286 --> 01:27:07,353
Ah!

587
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:14,394
Oh, my God, I need a gun.

588
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:38,284
English, please.

589
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:39,352
Good luck.

590
01:27:41,021 --> 01:27:42,955
Russian cocksucker.

591
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:44,157
Ah!

592
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,324
Fuck!

593
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:12,452
No!

594
01:29:15,482 --> 01:29:17,350
No more guns, John.

595
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:21,454
No more bullets.

596
01:29:22,456 --> 01:29:24,090
No more bullets.

597
01:29:32,366 --> 01:29:34,033
Just you and me, John.

598
01:29:35,202 --> 01:29:36,235
You and me.

599
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,395
What happened, John?

600
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:05,164
We were professionals.
Civilized.

601
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:07,033
Do I look civilized to you?

602
01:31:30,117 --> 01:31:31,951
Be seeing you, John.

603
01:31:34,087 --> 01:31:35,354
Yeah.

604
01:31:36,456 --> 01:31:38,124
Be seeing you.

605
01:32:29,376 --> 01:32:32,611
<i>Come on, John.
Let's go home.</i>

606
01:34:16,683 --> 01:34:17,750
It's okay.

607
01:34:19,419 --> 01:34:20,653
Let's go home.
