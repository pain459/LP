Design the System Architecture

    Control Unit (CU) Container: This unit authenticates voters and allows them to proceed to the voting unit. It might communicate with a voter database to verify voter IDs.
    Voting Unit (VU) Container: This is where the voter actually casts their votes. The interface allows selecting from available options.
    Counting Machine (CM) Container: This container stores the results and can tally the votes when required.
