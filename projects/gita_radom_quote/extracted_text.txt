Translation 
Dhṛtarāṣṭ ra said: O Sañjaya, after my sons and the sons of Pāṇḍu assembled in the 
place of pilgrimage at Kurukṣetra, desiring to fight, what did they do?  
Purport  
Bhagavad -gītā is the widely read theistic science su mmarized in the  Gītā-
māhātmya  (Glorification of the Gītā ). There it says that one should read Bhagavad-
gītā very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and try to 
understand  it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear 
understanding is there in the  Bhagavad -gītā itself, in the way the teaching is understood 
by Arjuna, who heard the  Gītā directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to 
understand the  Bhagavad -gītā in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated 
interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the 
world. One will find in the  Bhagavad -gītā all that is contained in other scriptures, but the 
reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific 
standard of the Gītā.  It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.  
The topics discussed by Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Sañjaya, as described in the  Mahābhārata,  form 
the basic principle for this great phil osophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved 
on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the 
immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present 
personally on this planet for the guidanc e of mankind.  
The word  dharma -kṣetra  (a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant 
because, on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was 
present on the side of Arjuna. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons’ ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his 
secretary Sañjaya, “What did they do?” He was confident that both his sons and the sons 
of his younger brother Pāṇḍu were assembled in that Field of Kurukṣetra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise 
between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the 
battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be foug ht at Kurukṣetra, which is 
mentioned elsewhere in the  Vedas  as a place of worship – even for the denizens of heaven 
– Dhṛtarāṣṭra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of 
the battle. He knew very well that this would infl uence Arjuna and the sons of Pāṇḍu 
favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sañjaya was a student of Vyāsa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vyāsa, Sañjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of 
Kurukṣetra even while he was in the room of Dhṛtar āṣṭra. And so, Dhṛtarāṣṭra asked him 
about the situation on the battlefield.  
Both the Pāṇḍavas and the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra belong to the same family, but Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s 
mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separat ed 
the sons of Pāṇḍu from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position 
of Dhṛtarāṣṭra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of Pāṇḍu. As in the paddy 
field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of 
these topics that in the religious field of Kurukṣetra, where the father of religion, Śrī 
Kṛṣṇa, was present, the unwanted plants like Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s son Duryodhana and others 
would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhiṣṭhira, would 
be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words  dharma -kṣetre  and kuru-
kṣetre,  apart from their historical and Vedic importance.

Purport  
By nature’s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity 
for everyone. In every ste p there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a 
bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of 
life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free 
from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire 
that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such 
that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one 
wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore 
advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the 
solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the discipli c succession. A person 
with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is 
the purport of this verse.  
Who is the man in material perple xities? It is he who does not understand the problems of 
life. In the  Bṛhad -āraṇyaka Upaniṣad (3.8.10) the perplexed man is described as 
follows:  yo vā etad akṣaraṁ gārgy aviditvāsmāḻ lokāt praiti sa kṛpaṇaḥ.  “He is a miserly 
man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like 
the cats a nd dogs, without understanding the science of self -realization.” This human form 
of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity, who can utilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a  miser. 
On the other hand, there is the  brāhmaṇa,  or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this 
body to solve all the problems of life.  Ya etad akṣaraṁ gārgi viditvāsmāl lokāt praiti sa 
brāhmaṇaḥ.  
The kṛpaṇas,  or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, 
societ y, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family 
life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of “skin disease.” 
The kṛpaṇa  thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or 
the kṛpaṇa  thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such 
family attachment can be found even in the lower animals, who take care of children also. 
Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and hi s 
wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities. Although he could 
understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, 
he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord Kṛṣṇa, the su preme spiritual 
master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to Kṛṣṇa as a disciple. He wants to 
stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna 
wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. Kṛṣṇa is therefore the 
original spiritual master of the science of  Bhagavad -gītā, and Arjuna is the first disciple 
for understanding the  Gītā.  How Arjuna understands the  Bhagavad- gītā is stated in 
the Gītā itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to 
Kṛṣṇa as a person, but to “the unborn within Kṛṣṇa.” There is no difference between 
Kṛṣṇa’s within and without. And one who has no sense of this understanding is the 
greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad -gītā.

śrī-bhagavān  uvāca — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said;  aśocyān  — not worthy 
of lamentation;  anvaśocaḥ — you are lamenting;  tvam  — you; prajñā- vādān  — learned 
talks;  ca — also;  bhāṣase  — speaking;  gata — lost; asūn  — life; agata — not 
passed;  asūn  — life; ca — also;  na — never;  anuśocanti  — lament;  paṇḍitāḥ  — the 
learned.  
Translation 
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: While speaking learned words, you are 
mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the 
living nor for the dead.  
Purport  
The Lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the student, calling him, 
indirectly, a fool. The Lord said, “You are talking like a learned man, but you do not know 
that one who is learned – one who knows what is body and what is soul –  does not lament 
for any stage of the body, neither in the living nor in the dead condition.” As explained in later chapters, it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the 
controller of both. Arjuna argued t hat religious principles should be given more 
importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul 
and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And because he was 
lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something 
which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished 
today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul. One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the 
condition of the material body.

Purport  
In the  Vedas  – in the  Kaṭha Upaniṣad  as well as in the  Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad – it is said 
that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the maintainer of innumerable living entities, 
in terms of their different situations according to individual work and reaction of work. 
That Supreme Personality of Godhead is also, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of 
every living entity. Only saintly persons who can see, within and without, the same 
Supreme Lord can actually attain to perfect and eternal peace.  
nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām  
eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān 
tam ātma -sthaṁ ye ’nupaśyanti dhīrās  
teṣāṁ śāntiḥ śāśvatī netareṣām  
(Kaṭha Upaniṣad 2.2.13)  
The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who pose 
themselves as ver y learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge. The Lord 
says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned and in their liberated situations. The 
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord’s 
eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It  is not 
that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain 
eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no c ause for lamentation for 
anyone.  
The Māyāvādī theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of māyā,  or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual 
existence is not supported herein by Lord Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority. Nor is the  theory 
that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. Kṛṣṇa clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is 
confirmed in the  Upaniṣads,  will continue eternally. This statement of Kṛṣṇa’s is 
authoritative because Kṛṣṇa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact, then Kṛṣṇa would not have stressed it so much – even for the future. The Māyāvādī may 
argue that the individuality spoken of by Kṛṣṇa is not spiritua l, but material. Even 
accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish 
Kṛṣṇa’s individuality? Kṛṣṇa affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His 
individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and 
impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. Kṛṣṇa has maintained 
spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in 
individual consciousness, then His  Bhagavad -gītā has no value as authoritative scripture. 
A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is 
worth hearing. The  Gītā is above such literature. No mundane book compares with 
the Bhagavad- gītā. When one accepts Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary man, the  Gītā loses all 
importance. The Māyāvādī argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But pr evious to this verse such a bodily 
conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living 
entities, how was it possible for Kṛṣṇa to place a conventional proposition on the body 
again? Therefore, individuality is maintained o n spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed 
by great  ācāryas  like Śrī Rāmānuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in 
the Gītā that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the 
Lord. Those who are envious of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no 
bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee’s approach to the teachings of 
the Gītā is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a 
taste of honey unless one opens  the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the  Bhagavad -
gītā can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the 
Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the  Gītā be touched b y persons who envy the very 
existence of the Lord. Therefore, the Māyāvādī explanation of the  Gītā is a most 
misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read 
commentations made by the Māyāvādīs and warns that one who takes  to such an 
understanding of the Māyāvādī philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery 
of the  Gītā.  If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of 
teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and the Lord is an eternal fact, 
and it is confirmed by the  Vedas  as above mentioned.

Translation 
As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old 
age, the soul simila rly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not 
bewildered by such a change.  
Purport  
Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, 
manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man. Yet 
the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally 
changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have 
another body in the next birth – either material or spi ritual – there was no cause for 
lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhīṣma nor for Droṇa, for whom 
he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to 
new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of 
enjoyment or suffering, according to one’s work in life. So Bhīṣma and Droṇa, being 
noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in 
heavenly bodies for superior enjoyme nt of material existence. So, in either case, there was 
no cause of lamentation.  
Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the 
Supersoul, and nature – both material and spiritual –  is called a  dhīra,  or a most sober 
man.  Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.  
The Māyāvādī theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained, on the ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into 
different individual soul s would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the 
principle of the Supreme Soul’s being unchangeable. As confirmed in the  Gītā,  the 
fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally ( sanātana ) and are called  kṣara;  that is, 
they have a tendenc y to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are 
eternally so, and even after liberation the individual soul remains the same –  fragmental. 
But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhea d. The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul, who is present in each 
and every individual body and is known as the Paramātmā. He is different from the 
individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent bo th 
the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities 
and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is 
represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead Śrī  Kṛṣṇa. 
They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth 
Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is not superior to Arjuna, 
then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless.  If both of them 
are deluded by the illusory energy ( māyā ), then there is no need of one being the instructor 
and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of māyā,  no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under  the circumstances, it is admitted 
that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by māyā.

dynasty.  
Translation 
O son of Kuntī, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their 
disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and di sappearance of winter 
and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one 
must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.  
Purport  
In the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent appearances and 
disappearances of happiness and distress. According to Vedic injunction, one has to take 
his bath early in the morning even during the month of Māgha (January- February). It is 
very cold at that time, but in spite of that a man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath. Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the 
kitchen in the months of May and June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to 
execute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to f ight is the religious 
principle of the  kṣatriyas,  and although one has to fight with some friend or relative, one 
should not deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to follow the prescribed rules and 
regulations of religious principles in order to rise u p to the platform of knowledge, 
because by knowledge and devotion only can one liberate himself from the clutches of māyā  (illusion).  
The two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. To address him as 
Kaunteya signifies his great bl ood relations from his mother’s side; and to address him as 
Bhārata signifies his greatness from his father’s side. From both sides he is supposed to 
have a great heritage. A great heritage brings responsibility in the matter of proper 
discharge of duties;  therefore, he cannot avoid fighting.

Translation 
For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, 
does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever -
existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.  
Purport  
Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, 
or kūṭa-stha.  The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth from the 
womb of the mother’s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, 
gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go 
through such changes. The soul is not born, but,  because he takes on a material body, the 
body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, 
present or future. He is et ernal, ever -existing and primeval – that is, there is no trace in 
history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of 
birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-
called  old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or 
youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a 
tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by -product either. The by -products o f the 
body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they 
appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul’s presence, 
but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is f ree from the six 
changes of the body.  
In the  Kaṭha Upaniṣad (1.2.18) we also find a similar passage, which reads:  
na jāyate mriyate vā vipaścin  
nāyaṁ kutaścin na babhūva kaścit  
ajo nityaḥ śāśvato ’yaṁ purāṇo  
na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre  
The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the  Bhagavad -gītā, but here in this 
verse there is one special word,  vipaścit,  which means learned or with knowledge.  
The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness 
is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is 
situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for  some 
other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is 
therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can 
understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is som e consciousness in all 
bodies – whether man or animal –  we can understand the presence of the soul. This 
consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all -knowledge – past, prese nt and future. The 
consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his 
real nature, he obtains education and enlightenmen t from the superior lessons of Kṛṣṇa. 
But Kṛṣṇa is not like the forgetful soul. If so, Kṛṣṇa’s teachings of  Bhagavad -gītā would 
be useless.  
There are two kinds of souls – namely the minute particle soul ( aṇu-ātmā ) and the 
Supersoul ( vibhu -ātmā ). This is also confirmed in the  Kaṭha Upaniṣad (1.2.20) in this 
way:  
aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān  
ātmāsya jantor nihito guhāyām  
tam akratuḥ paśyati vīta- śoko 
dhātuḥ prasādān mahimānam ātmanaḥ  
“Both the Supersoul [Paramā tmā] and the atomic soul [  jīvātmā ] are situated on the same 
tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become 
free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, 
understand the glories of the soul.” Kṛṣṇa is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it 
will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his 
real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by Kṛṣṇa, or by His bona fide repres entative (the spiritual master).

Translation  
For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into 
being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever- existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.  
Purport  
Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or  kūṭa-stha.  The body is subject to six kinds of transfor mations. It takes its 
birth from the womb of the mother’s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, bec ause he 
takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eterna l, ever -
existing and primeval –  that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. 
Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so- called old  man, 
therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by- product either. The by- products of the 
body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, 
they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul’s 
presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.  
In the  Kaṭha Upaniṣad  (1.2.18) we also find a similar passage, which reads:  
na jāyate mriyate vā vipaścin  
nāyaṁ kutaścin na babhūva kaścit  
ajo nityaḥ śāśvato ’yaṁ purāṇo  
na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre  
The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the  Bhagavad -gītā, but here 
in this verse there is one special word,  vipaścit,  which means learned or with 
knowledge.  
The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is th e symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul within 
the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for  some other reason, but the light of the sun is always 
there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little 
light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. 
Similarly, since there is som e consciousness in all bodies –  whether man or animal –  
we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all -knowledge – past, prese nt and future. The consciousness of the 
individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he 
obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa 
is not like the forgetful soul. If so, Kṛṣṇa’s teachings of  Bhagavad- gītā would be 
useless.  
There are two kinds of souls –  namely the minute particle soul ( aṇu-ātmā ) and the 
Supersoul ( vibhu-ātmā ). This is also confirmed in the  Kaṭha Upaniṣad (1.2.20) in 
this way:  
aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān  
ātmāsya jantor nihito guhāyām  
tam akratuḥ paśyati vīta- śoko 
dhātuḥ prasādān mahimānam ātmanaḥ  
“Both the Supersoul [Paramātmā] and the atomic soul [  jīvātmā] are situated on the 
same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who 
has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.” Kṛṣṇa is the  fountainhead of the 
Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by Kṛṣṇa, or by His bona fide representative (the spiritual master).

the embodied.  
Translation 
As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old an d useless ones.  
Purport  
Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even the modern 
scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot 
explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept co ntinuous changes of body 
which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already 
been explained in a previous verse (2.13).  
Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace 
of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills 
the desire of another. The  Vedas,  like the  Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad,  as well as the  Śvetāśvatara 
Upaniṣad,  compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same 
tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (Kṛṣṇa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds – altho ugh they are 
the same in quality – one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is 
simply witnessing the activities of His friend. Kṛṣṇa is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still  the master and the other is the 
servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one’s 
changing his position from one tree to another, or from one body to another. The  jīva soul 
is struggling very hard on the tree of the mate rial body, but as soon as he agrees to accept 
the other bird as the supreme spiritual master – as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary 
surrender unto Kṛṣṇa for instruction – the subordinate bird immediately becomes free 
from all lamentations. Both the  Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad (3.1.2) and Śvetāśvatara 
Upaniṣad (4.7) confirm this:  
samāne vṛkṣe puruṣo nimagno  
’nīśayā śocati muhyamānaḥ  
juṣṭaṁ yadā paśyaty anyam īśam  
asya mahimānam iti vīta -śokaḥ  
“Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engross ed with 
anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other 
he turns his face to his friend the Lord and knows His glories – at once the suffering bird 
becomes free from all anxieties.” Arjuna has now turned his fac e towards his eternal 
friend, Kṛṣṇa, and is understanding the  Bhagavad -gītā from Him. And thus, hearing from 
Kṛṣṇa, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.  
Arjuna is  advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old 
grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous 
fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activi ties. 
One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once 
cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause 
for Arjuna’s lamentation.

also;  enam  — this soul;  kledayanti  — moistens;  āpaḥ  — water;  na — never;  śoṣayati  —

Translation 
The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor 
moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.  
Purport  
All kinds of weapons – swords, flame weapons, rain weapons, tornado weapons, etc. – are 
unable to kill the spirit soul. It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of 
earth, water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire. Even the nuclear 
weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons , but formerly there were other 
weapons made of all different types of material elements. Fire weapons were counteracted 
by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern science. Nor do modern scientists 
have knowledge of tornado weapons. Nonetheless, the  soul can never be cut into pieces, 
nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.  
The Māyāvādī cannot explain how the individual soul came into existence simply by 
ignorance and consequently became covered by the illusory ener gy. Nor was it ever 
possible to cut the individual souls from the original Supreme Soul; rather, the individual souls are eternally separated parts of the Supreme Soul. Because they are atomic individual souls eternally ( sanātana ), they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, 
and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of a fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the  Varāha Purāṇa,  the living e ntities are described as separated parts 
and parcels of the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the  Bhagavad -gītā also. 
So, even after being liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a se parate identity, as 
is evident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna became liberated by the 
knowledge received from Kṛṣṇa, but he never became one with Kṛṣṇa.

Translation 
One who has taken his birth is sure to die, and after death one is sure to take birth 
again. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament.  
Purport  
One has to take birth accordi ng to one’s activities of life. And after finishing one term of 
activities, one has to die to take birth for the next. In this way one is going through one 
cycle of birth and death after another without liberation. This cycle of birth and death does 
not, however, support unnecessary murder, slaughter and war. But at the same time, 
violence and war are inevitable factors in human society for keeping law and order.  
The Battle of Kurukṣetra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable event, and to 
fight for the right cause is the duty of a  kṣatriya.  Why should he be afraid of or aggrieved 
at the death of his relatives since he was discharging his proper duty? He did not deserve 
to break the law, thereby becoming subjected to the reactions of sinful acts, of which he 
was so afraid. By avoiding the discharge of his proper duty, he would not be able to stop 
the death of his relatives, and he would be degraded due to his selection of the wrong path 
of action.

Translation  
O descendant of Bharata, he who dwells in the body can never be slain. Therefore you 
need not grieve for any living being.  
Purport  
The Lord now concludes the chapter of instruction on the immutable spirit soul. In 
describing the immortal soul in various ways, Lord Kṛṣṇa establishes that the soul is 
immortal and the body is temporary. Therefore Arjuna as a  kṣatriya  should not abandon 
his duty out of fear that his grandfather and teacher – Bhīṣma and Droṇa – will die in the 
battle. On the authority of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one has to believe that there is a soul different from 
the material body, not that there is no such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop 
at a certain stage of material maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals. Though 
the soul is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at t he time of war it is not 
discouraged when there is actual need for it. That need must be justified in terms of the 
sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously.

can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.  
Purport  
Activity in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or acting for the benefit of Kṛṣṇa without expectation of 
sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of work. Even a small beginning 
of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. 
Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt 
becomes a failure. But any work begun in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has a permanent effect, 
even though not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his 
work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness 
bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, 
whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no profit. Ajāmila performed his duty in some percentage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but the result he enjoyed 
at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this 
connection in Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam (1.5.17) : 
tyaktvā sva -dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer  
bhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi  
yatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁ  
ko vārtha āpto ’bhajatāṁ sva -dharmataḥ  
“If someone gives up his occupational duties and works in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then 
falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And 
what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?” Or, as the Christians 
say, “What profiteth a man if he gain the whol e world yet suffer the loss of his eternal 
soul?”  
Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness carries a person again to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance  in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the 
family of a great cultured  brāhmaṇa or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a 
further chance for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

consciousness.  
Translation 
Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved 
child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many -branched.  
Purport  
A strong faith that by Kṛṣṇa consciousness one will be elevated to the highest perfection 
of life is called  vyavasāyātmikā intelligence. The  Caitanya -caritāmṛta  (Madhya  22.62) 
states:  
‘śraddhā’ -śabde – viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya  
kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva- karma kṛta haya  
Faith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the duties of 
Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations 
to family traditions, humanity or nationality. Fruitive activities are the enga gements of 
one’s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, 
he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in 
Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject 
to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is 
renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by 
progressive Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  
The resolute purpose of a pers on in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is based on 
knowledge.  Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su -durlabhaḥ:  a person in Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that Vāsudeva, or Kṛṣṇa, is the 
root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree one automatically 
distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone –  namely self, family, society, country, humanity, 
etc. If Kṛṣṇa is satisfied by one’s actions, the n everyone will be satisfied.  
Service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa, who knows the nature of the 
student and who can guide him to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As such, to be well versed 
in Kṛṣṇa consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of Kṛṣṇa, and 
one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one’s mission in life. 
Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual 
master, as follows:  
yasya prasādād bhagavat- prasādo  
yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi  
dhyāyan stuvaṁs tasya yaśas tri -sandhyaṁ  
vande guroḥ śrī -caraṇāravindam  
“By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes 
satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted 
to the plane of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my res pectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.”  
The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body – not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer a chance 
for sense gratification manifest ed in fruitive activities. One who is not firmly fixed in 
mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.

Translation 
The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature. O 
Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be fr ee from all dualities and 
from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self.  
Purport  
All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. 
They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. 
The Vedas  deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from 
the field of sense gratification to a posi tion on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a 
student and friend of Lord Kṛṣṇa, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position 
of Vedānta  philosophy where, in the beginning, there is  brahma -jijñāsā,  or questions on 
the supreme transcendence. A ll the living entities who are in the material world are 
struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. 
When the activities f or sense gratification, namely the  karma- kāṇḍa  chapter, are finished, 
then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the  Upaniṣads,  which are 
part of different  Vedas,  as the  Bhagavad -gītā is a part of the fifth  Veda,  namely 
the Mahābhārata.  The Upaniṣads  mark the beginning of transcendental life.  
As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. 
One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, o r cold 
and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain 
and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness when one is 
fully dependent on the good will of Kṛṣṇa.

Translation 
All purposes served by a small well can at once be served by a great reservoir of 
water. Similarly , all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the 
purpose behind them.  
Purport  
The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the  karma -kāṇḍa  division of the Vedic literature 
are meant to encourage gradual development of self -realization. And the  purpose of self -
realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the  Bhagavad- gītā (15.15) : the 
purpose of studying the  Vedas  is to know Lord Kṛṣṇa, the primeval cause of everything. 
So, se lf-realization means understanding Kṛṣṇa and one’s eternal relationship with Him. 
The relationship of the living entities with Kṛṣṇa is also mentioned in the Fifteenth 
Chapter of  Bhagavad -gītā (15.7) . The living entities are parts and parcels of Kṛṣṇa; 
therefore, revival of Kṛṣṇa consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest 
perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the  Śrīmad -
Bhāgavatam (3.33.7)  as follows:  
aho bata śva -paco ’to garīyān  
yaj-jihvāgre vartate nāma tubhyam  
tepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur āryā  
brahmānūcur nāma gṛṇanti ye te  
“O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low fam ily like 
that of a  caṇḍāla  [dog-eater], is situated on the highest platform of self -realization. Such a 
person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic 
rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taki ng his bath in all the 
holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the Āryan family.”  
So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the  Vedas,  without being 
attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms 
for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the common man in this age 
to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals, nor is it possible to study all of 
the Vedānta and the  Upaniṣa ds thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and 
resources to execute the purposes of the  Vedas.  This is hardly possible in this age. The 
best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya 
was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, why He, the Lord, was 
chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of 
studying Vedānta  philosophy, the Lord  replied that His spiritual master had found Him to 
be a great fool and thus asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He did so, and 
became ecstatic like a madman. In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and 
not adequately educated to  understand Vedānta  philosophy; the best purpose 
of Vedānta  philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the 
Lord.  Vedānta  is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of 
the Vedānta philosophy is Lord Kṛṣṇa; and the highe st Vedāntist is the great soul who 
takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism.

viṣayāḥ — objects for sense enjoyment;  vinivartante  — are practiced to be refrained 
from;  nirāhārasya — by negative restrictions;  dehinaḥ — for the embodied; rasa-
varjam — giving up the taste;  rasaḥ — sense of enjoyment;  api — although there 
is; asya — his; param  — far superior things; dṛṣṭvā  — by experiencing;  nivartate  — he

Translation 
Though the embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, the taste for 
sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a high er taste, 
he is fixed in consciousness.  
Purport  
Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment. 
The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like 
restricting a diseased per son from certain types of eatables. The patient, however, neither 
likes such restrictions nor loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some 
spiritual process like  aṣṭāṅga -yoga,  in the matter of  yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, 
pratyāhār a, dhāraṇā, dhyāna,  etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have 
no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, in the course of his advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead, materi al 
things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good until one actually has a taste for 
Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one is actually Kṛṣṇa conscious, he autom atically loses his 
taste for pale things.

Translation 
While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for 
them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.  
Purport  
One who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious is subjected to material desires while contemplating t he 
objects of the senses. The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in 
the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the 
service of materialism. In the material world everyone, including Lord Ś iva and Lord 
Brahmā – to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets –  is subjected to the 
influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Lord Śiva was deep in meditat ion, but when 
Pārvatī agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result 
Kārtikeya was born. When Haridāsa Ṭhākura was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of Māyā -devī, but Haridāsa easily passe d the test 
because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord Kṛṣṇa. As illustrated in the above -mentioned 
verse of Śrī Yāmunācārya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord. 
That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agita te him to gratify his desires.

Purport  
Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has given us this direction:  
prāpañcikatayā buddhyā  
hari- sambandhi -vastunaḥ 
mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo  
vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate  
(Bhakti -rasāmṛta -sindhu  1.2.258)  
By development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness  one can know that everything has its use in the 
service of the Lord. Those who are without knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness artificially 
try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material 
bondage, they do not att ain to the perfect stage of renunciation. Their so -called 
renunciation is called  phalgu,  or less important. On the other hand, a person in Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does 
not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the 
Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to 
avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats 
all that is offere d to Him in devotion. So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the 
devotee takes the remnants, called  prasādam.  Thus everything becomes spiritualized, and 
there is no danger of a downfall. The devotee takes  prasādam in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, 
whereas the  nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy 
life, due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind 
pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said that such a so ul, even 
though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not having support 
in devotional service.

Translation 
But a person free from all attachment and aversion and able to control his senses 
through regulative principles of free dom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord.  
Purport  
It is already explained that one may externally control the senses by some artificial 
process, but unless the senses are engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there 
is every chance of a fa ll. Although the person in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness may apparently 
be on the sensual plane, because of his being Kṛṣṇa conscious he has no attachment to 
sensual activities. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of 
Kṛṣṇa, and nothing else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment and detachment. 
If Kṛṣṇa wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if Kṛṣṇa 
does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own 
satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under 
the direction of Kṛṣṇa. This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the 
devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform.

Translation 
What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self -controlled; and the 
time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.  
Purport  
There are two classes  of intelligent men. One is intelligent in material activities for sense 
gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to the cultivation of self -realization. 
Activities of the introspective sage, or thoughtful man, are night for persons material ly 
absorbed. Materialistic persons remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of 
self-realization. The introspective sage remains alert in the “night” of the materialistic 
men. The sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual culture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to self -realization, dreams 
of varieties of sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy and sometimes distressed in his 
sleeping condition. The introspective man is always indifferent  to materialistic happiness 
and distress. He goes on with his self -realization activities undisturbed by material 
reactions.

Synonyms  
yajña- arthāt — done only for the sake of Yajña, or Viṣṇu;  karmaṇaḥ  — than 
work;  anyatra — otherwise;  lokaḥ  — world;  ayam  — this; karma -bandhanaḥ  — bondage 
by work;  tat — of Him;  artham — for the sake;  karma  — work;  kaunteya  — O son of 
Kuntī;  mukta -saṅgaḥ  — liberated from association;  samācara — do perfectly.  
Translation 
Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed; otherwise work causes 
bondage in this material world. Therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform your prescribed 
duties for His  satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from 
bondage.  
Purport  
Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties 
for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be 
fulfilled.  Yajña  means Lord Viṣṇu, or sacrificial performances. All sacrificial 
performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Viṣṇu. The  Vedas  enjoin:  yajño 
vai viṣṇuḥ.  In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs 
prescribed  yajñas  or directl y serves Lord Viṣṇu. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is therefore 
performance of  yajña as it is prescribed in this verse. The  varṇāśrama institution also aims 
at satisfying Lord Viṣṇu.  Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān/ viṣṇur 
ārādhyate  (Viṣṇu Purāṇa  3.8.8).  
Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu. Any other work done in this 
material world will be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their 
reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in Kṛṣṇa 
conscio usness to satisfy Kṛṣṇa (or Viṣṇu); and while performing such activities one is in a 
liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process 
requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert 
guidance of a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, or under the direct instruction of Lord Kṛṣṇa 
Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed 
for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of Kṛ ṣṇa. This 
practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but also gradually elevate one to 
transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of 
God.

Translation 
All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are 
produced by performance of yajña [s acrifice], and yajña is born of prescribed duties.  
Purport  
Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a great commentator on the  Bhagavad -gītā, writes as 
follows:  ye indrādy -aṅgatayāvasthitaṁ yajñaṁ sarveśvaraṁ viṣṇum abhyarcya tac -
cheṣam aśnanti tena tad deha -yātrāṁ sampādayanti, te santaḥ sarveśvarasya yajña-
puruṣasya bhaktāḥ sarva- kilbiṣair anādi -kāla-vivṛddhair ātmānubhava- pratibandhakair 
nikhilaiḥ pāpair vimucyante.  The Supreme Lord, who is known as the  yajña -puruṣa , or 
the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all the demigods, who serve Him 
as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra and 
Varuṇa are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the  Vedas  direct sacrifices 
to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water 
sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshiped, the demigods, who 
are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no 
separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are 
in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, offer food to Kṛṣṇa and then eat – a process which nourishes the 
body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful  reactions in the body vanquished, 
but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Viṣṇu and then taken by us makes us 
sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who eats only food offered to Kṛṣṇa, can counteract all rea ctions of past material infections, which are 
impediments to the progress of self -realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so 
continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to 
resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer  the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is 
full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting prasādam of the Lord 
(food offered to Viṣṇu) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes 
subjected to contamination.  
Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and 
vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh 
must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, 
ultimately, w e have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of 
big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are 
controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the  Lord. 
The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find 
himself in scarcity –  that is the law of nature.  Yajña,  specifically the  saṅkīrtana -
yajña  prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at le ast from scarcity 
of food supply.

Translation 
Whatever action a great man performs, co mmon men follow. And whatever 
standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.  
Purport  
People in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical behavior. 
A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smoke s. Lord Caitanya said 
that a teacher should behave properly before he begins teaching. One who teaches in that 
way is called  ācārya,  or the ideal teacher. Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles 
of śāstra  (scripture) to teach the common man. The te acher cannot manufacture rules 
against the principles of revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like  Manu-
saṁhitā and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human 
society. Thus the leader’s teaching should be based on the principles of such standard  śāstras.  One who desires to improve himself must follow the standard rules as 
they are practiced by the great teachers. The  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  also affirms that one 
should foll ow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress on the 
path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head of a state, the father and the 
schoolteacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in gene ral. All 
such natural leaders have a great responsibility to their dependents; therefore they must be 
conversant with standard books of moral and spiritual codes.

Translation 
The spirit soul bewildered by the influence of false ego thinks himself the doer of 
activities that are  in actuality carried out by the three modes of material nature.  
Purport  
Two persons, one in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and the other in material consciousness, working on the same level, may appear to be working on the same platform, but there is a 
wide gulf of difference in their respective positions. The person in material consciousness 
is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of everything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by material nature, which works under the supervision 
of the Supreme Lord. The materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimat ely he is 
under the control of Kṛṣṇa. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing everything 
independently, and that is the symptom of his nescience. He does not know that this gross 
and subtle body is the creation of material nature, under the orde r of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, and as such his bodily and mental activities should be engaged in 
the service of Kṛṣṇa, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The ignorant man forgets that the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead is known as Hṛṣīkeśa, or the master of  the senses of the material 
body, for due to his long misuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually 
bewildered by the false ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa.

Translation  
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of 
contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which 
is the all- devouring sinful enemy of this world.  
Purport  
When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for Kṛṣṇa is 
transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of 
love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is 
transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is 
transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the 
greatest enemy of the living entity , and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to 
remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; 
these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of 
passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of 
goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the 
degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.  
The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing 
spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also 
have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is 
transformed into the pr opensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This 
material creation is created by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these 
lustful propensities, and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living 
entities begin to inquire about their real position. This inquiry is the beginning of the Vedānta-sūtras, wherein it is said, athāto brahma-
jijñāsā: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined in Śrīmad-
Bhāgavatam as  janmādy asya yato ’nvayād itarataś ca, or, “The origin of everything is the 
Supreme Brahman.” Therefore the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into Kṛṣṇa consciousness – or, in other 
words, desiring everything for Kṛṣṇa – then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. 
Hanumān, the great servitor of Lord Rāma, exhibited his wrath by burning the golden city of 
Rāvaṇa, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the Lord. Here also, in Bhagavad -
gītā, the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the 
Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, become our 
friends instead of our enemies.

Translation 
The Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, said: I instructed this imperishable 
science of yoga to the sun -god, Vivasvān, and Vivasvān instru cted it to Manu, the 
father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikṣvāku.  
Purport  
Herein we find the history of the  Bhagavad -gītā traced from a remote time when it was 
delivered to the royal order  of all planets, beginning from the sun planet. The kings of all 
planets are especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants, and therefore the royal 
order should understand the science of  Bhagavad -gītā in order to be able to rule the 
citizens and protect them from material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for 
cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, and the executive heads of all states  and all planets are obliged to impart this 
lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive 
heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this  great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the 
opportunity of the human form of life.  
In this millennium, the sun -god is known as Vivasvān, the king of the sun, which is the 
origin of all planets within the solar system. In the  Brahma -saṁhitā  (5.52) it is stated:  
yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala -grahāṇāṁ  
rājā samasta -sura-mūrtir aśeṣa -tejāḥ  
yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta- kāla-cakro  
govindam ādi- puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi  
“Let me worship,” Lord Brahmā said, “the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda 
[Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all 
planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and 
traverses its orbit in obedience to His order.”  
The sun is the king of the pla nets, and the sun- god (at present of the name Vivasvān) rules 
the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is 
rotating under the order of Kṛṣṇa, and Lord Kṛṣṇa originally made Vivasvān His first 
disciple to underst and the science of  Bhagavad -gītā. The Gītā is not, therefore, a 
speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of 
knowledge coming down from time immemorial.  
In the  Mahābhārata (Śānti -parva  348.51– 52) we can trace out the history of the  Gītā as 
follows:  
tretā -yugādau ca tato  
vivasvān manave dadau  
manuś ca loka -bhṛty -arthaṁ  
sutāyekṣvākave dadau  
ikṣvākuṇā ca kathito  
vyāpya lokān avasthitaḥ  
“In the beginning of the millennium  known as Tretā -yuga this science of the relationship 
with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvān to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, the king of this earth planet and forefather 
of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord Rāmacandra appeared.” Therefore,  Bhagavad -
gītā existed in human society from the time of Mahārāja Ikṣvāku.  
At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali -yuga, 
which l asts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dvāpara -yuga (800,000 years), and 
before that there was Tretā -yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, 
Manu spoke the  Bhagavad- gītā to his disciple and son Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, the king of this 
planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of 
which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu the  Gītā was 
spoken by the Lord to His disciple the  sun-god Vivasvān, a rough estimate is that 
the Gītā was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been 
extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five 
thousand years ago. That is the rough esti mate of the history of the  Gītā,  according to 
the Gītā itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. It was spoken 
to the sun -god Vivasvān because he is also a  kṣatriya  and is the father of all  kṣatriyas  who 
are descendants of the sun -god, or the  sūrya -vaṁśa kṣatriyas.  Because  Bhagavad -gītā is 
as good as the  Vedas,  being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this 
knowledge is  apauruṣeya,  superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions  are accepted as they 
are, without human interpretation, the  Gītā must therefore be accepted without mundane 
interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the  Gītā in their own ways, but 
that is not  Bhagavad -gītā as it is. Therefore,  Bhagavad -gītā has to be accepted as it is, 
from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun- god, 
the sun -god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ikṣvāku.

Translation 
This supreme science was th us received through the chain of disciplic succession, and 
the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was 
broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.  
Purport  
It is clearly stated that the  Gītā was e specially meant for the saintly kings because they 
were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly  Bhagavad -gītā was never 
meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its value for no one’s benefit and 
would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the 
original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there 
arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was 
detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He 
declared that the purpose of the  Gītā appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present 
moment also there are so many editions of the  Gītā (especially in English), but almost all 
of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable 
interpretations rendere d by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not 
accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, although they make a good business 
on the words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God 
but simply enjoy the  property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of 
the Gītā in English, as it is received by the  paramparā  (disciplic succession) system, an 
attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want.  Bhagavad -gītā – accepted as it is –  is a 
great boon to humanity; but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is 
simply a waste of time.

Purport  
There are two classes of men, namely the devotee and the demon. The Lord selected Arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his being a devotee of the Lord, but 
for the demon it is not possible to understand this great myst erious science. There are a 
number of editions of this great book of knowledge. Some of them have commentaries by 
the devotees, and some of them have commentaries by the demons. Commentation by the 
devotees is real, whereas that of the demons is useless. A rjuna accepts Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the  Gītā following in the 
footsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great science. The demonic, however, do not accept Lord Kṛṣṇa as He is. Inste ad they concoct something 
about Kṛṣṇa and mislead general readers from the path of Kṛṣṇa’s instructions. Here is a 
warning about such misleading paths. One should try to follow the disciplic succession 
from Arjuna, and thus be benefited by this great science of  
Śrīmad Bhagavad -gītā.

Translation 
Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although 
I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium in My original 
transcendental form.  
Purport  
The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an 
ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past “births,” whereas a 
common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a 
common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare 
claim to be God, or Kṛṣṇa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then 
again, the Lord explains His  prakṛti,  or His form.  Prakṛti  means “nature,” as well 
as svarūpa,  or “one’s own form.” The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He 
does not change His body, as the  common living entity changes from one body to another. 
The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different 
body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but 
transmigrates from on e body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He 
appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, 
Kṛṣṇa appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding 
a flute. He ap pears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. 
Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still 
appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. And although His body does 
not deteriorate like a material body, it still appears that Lord Kṛṣṇa grows from childhood 
to boyhood and from boyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond 
youth. At the time of the Battle of Kurukṣetra, He had many grandchildren at home ; or, in 
other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a 
young man twenty or twenty- five years old. We never see a picture of Kṛṣṇa in old age 
because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation – past, present and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or 
changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the 
same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body 
and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun’s rising, 
moving before us and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, 
we think that the sun has set, and when the su n is before our eyes, we think that the sun is 
on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, 
insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. 
And because Lord Kṛṣṇa’s  appearance and disappearance are completely different from 
that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful 
knowledge by His internal potency –  and He is never contaminated by material nature. 
The Vedas  also confirm t hat the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn yet He still 
appears to take His birth in multimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also 
confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without 
change of body. I n the  Bhāgavatam , He appears before His mother as Nārāyaṇa, with four 
hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His 
original eternal form is His causeless mercy, besto wed upon the living entities so that they 
can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, and not on mental concoctions or 
imaginations, which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the Lord’s forms to be. The 
word  māyā,  or ātma -māyā,  refers to the Lord’s causeles s mercy, according to the  Viśva -
kośa dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and 
disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon 
as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs 
wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is 
always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, 
or between His quality and body. A question may now be  raised as to why the Lord 
appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse.

Translation 
Whenever and wherever there is a decline in relig ious practice, O descendant of 
Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion –  at that time I descend Myself.  
Purport  
The word sṛjāmi  is significant herein.  Sṛjāmi cannot be used in the sense of creation, 
because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord’s form or body, 
since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore,  sṛjāmi  means that the Lord 
manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of 
the Dvāpara -yuga of the twenty -eighth mille nnium of the seventh Manu in one day of 
Brahmā, He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is 
completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will 
whenever there is a predominance of irreligios ity and a disappearance of true religion. 
Principles of religion are laid down in the  Vedas,  and any discrepancy in the matter of 
properly executing the rules of the  Vedas  makes one irreligious. In the  Bhāg avatam it is 
stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a 
system of religion. The  Vedas  are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself 
to Brahmā, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of  dhar ma, or religion, are the 
direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead ( dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat -
praṇītam ). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the  Bhagavad- gītā. The 
purpose of the  Vedas  is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, 
and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the  Gītā,  that the highest principle of religion is 
to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards 
complete surrender unto Him; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the 
demoniac, the Lord appears. From the  Bhāgavatam  we understand that Lord Buddha is the 
incarnation of Kṛṣṇa who appeared when mat erialism was rampant and materialists were 
using the pretext of the authority of the  Vedas.  Although there are certain restrictive rules 
and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the  Vedas,  people of 
demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. 
Lord Buddha appeared in order to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles 
of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avatāra,  or incarnation of the Lord, has a 
particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an  avatāra unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord 
appears only on Indian soil . He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and 
whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. 
But the mission is the  same – to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the 
principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His 
bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised 
form.  
The princi ples of the  Bhagavad -gītā were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other 
highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in 
other parts of the world. Two plus tw o equals four is a mathematical principle that is true 
in the beginner’s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher 
and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are 
taught, but they  appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher 
principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of 
social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is 
to arouse Kṛṣṇa consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and 
nonmanifest only under different circumstances.

Purport  
According to Bhagavad -gītā, a sādhu  (holy man) is a man in Kṛṣṇa consciousnes s. A 
person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of Kṛṣṇa consciousness 
wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a  sādhu.  And duṣkṛtām  applies to those who 
do not care for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Such miscreants, or  duṣkṛtām,  are described as 
foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane 
education, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness 
is accepted as a  sādhu,  even though such a person may be neither learned nor well 
cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to 
appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Rāvaṇa and Kaṁsa. The Lord 
has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the  Lord especially 
descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. 
The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. 
Although Prahlāda Mahārāja was the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, he was nonethele ss persecuted 
by his father; although Devakī, the mother of Kṛṣṇa, was the sister of Kaṁsa, she and her 
husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because Kṛṣṇa was to be born of them. So Lord 
Kṛṣṇa appeared primarily to deliver Devakī rather than kill Kaṁsa, b ut both were 
performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and 
vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.  
In the  Caitanya -caritāmṛta  of Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, the following verses ( Madhya  20.26 3–
264) summarize these principles of incarnation:  
sṛṣṭi-hetu yei mūrti prapañce avatare  
sei īśvara -mūrti ‘avatāra’ nāma dhare  
māyātīta paravyome sabāra avasthāna  
viśve avatari’ dhare ‘avatāra’ nāma  
“The  avatāra,  or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the  kingdom of God for material 
manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is 
called an incarnation, or  avatāra.  Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the 
kingdom of God. When they descend to the mate rial creation, they assume the 
name  avatāra. ” 
There are various kinds of  avatāras,  such as  puruṣāvatāras, guṇāvatāras, līlāvatāras, 
śakty -āveśa avatāras, manvantara- avatāras  and yugāvatāras  – all appearing on schedule 
all over the universe. But Lord Kṛṣṇa is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of 
all avatāras.  Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa descends for the specific purpose of mitigating the anxieties 
of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original Vṛndāvana 
pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of t he Kṛṣṇa  avatāra is to satisfy His unalloyed 
devotees.  
The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He 
incarnates also in the Age of Kali. As stated in the  Śrīmad -Bhāgav atam , the incarnation in 
the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who spread the worship of Kṛṣṇa by 
the saṅkīrtana  movement (congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of  saṅkīrtana  would be 
broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as 
the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly 
in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures,  such as the  Upaniṣads, 
Mahābhārata  and Bhāgavatam . The devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa are very much attracted by 
the saṅkīrtana  movement of Lord Caitanya. This  avatāra of the Lord does not kill the 
miscreants, bu t delivers them by His causeless mercy.

Translation 
One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does no t, 
upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My 
eternal abode, O Arjuna.  
Purport  
The Lord’s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the sixth verse. One who can understand the truth of the appeara nce of the Personality of Godhead is 
already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God 
immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity 
from material bondage is not at all eas y. The impersonalists and the  yogīs  attain liberation 
only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve – 
merging into the impersonal  brahma- jyotir  of the Lord – is only partial, and there is the 
risk of returning to thi s material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the 
transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning to this material world. In 
the Brahma -saṁhitā  (5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and 
incarnations:  advaitam acyutam anādim ananta -rūpam.  Although there are many 
transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to under stand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible 
to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the  Vedas  (Puruṣa -bodhinī 
Upaniṣad ): 
eko devo nitya -līlānurakto  
bhakta- vyāpī hṛdy antar -ātmā  
“The one Supreme Personality of Godhead  is eternally engaged in many, many 
transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.” This Vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the  Gītā personally by the Lord. He who accepts this truth on 
the strength of the authority of the  Veda s and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and 
who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional 
stage of liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain 
liberation. The Vedic vers ion tat tvam asi  is actually applied in this case. Anyone who 
understands Lord Kṛṣṇa to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, “You are the same 
Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead,” is certainly liberated instantly, and 
consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In 
other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed 
by the following Vedic assertion:  
tam eva viditvāti mṛtyum eti  
nānyaḥ panthā vidyate ’yanāya  
“One can attain the  perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the 
Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there is no other way to achieve this perfection.” ( Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 3.8) That there is no alternative means that anyone 
who does not  understand Lord Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in 
the mode of ignorance and consequently he will not attain salvation simply, so to speak, 
by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the  Bhagavad -
gītā according to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume very 
important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed -up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of 
the Lord. One should therefore cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness with faith and knowledge, 
and in this way attain perfection.

Translation 
Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking

and thus they all attaine d transcendental love for Me.  
Purport  
As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are 
attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost 
impossible for them to understand how the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists 
cannot even imagine that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. I n the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full 
of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form o f the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. 
Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too 
materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from 
matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and 
personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a 
kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to 
the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of 
spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage 
of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many 
persons who c annot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarrassed by so many 
theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become 
disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that 
everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people 
are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of 
them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in  
everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last 
class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective 
hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid o f all three 
stages of material consciousness: attachment to material life, fear of a spiritual personal 
identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life. To get free from 
these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative 
principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called bhāva,  or 
transcendental love of Godhead.  
According to Bhakti- rasāmṛta -sindhu  (1.4.15– 16), the science of devotional service:  
ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-  
saṅgo ’tha bhajana -kriyā  
tato ’nartha -nivṛttiḥ syāt  
tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ  
athāsaktis tato bhāvas  
tataḥ premābhyudañcati 
sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ  
prādurbhāve b havet kramaḥ 
“In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self -realization. This will bring 
one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In the next 
stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual mast er, and under his instruction the 
neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional 
service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material 
attachment, attains steadiness in self -realizatio n, and acquires a taste for hearing ab out the 
Absolute Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is matured in  bhāva,  or the preliminary stage 
of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called prema,  the highes t perfectional 
stage of life.” In the  prema  stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving 
service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of 
the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest  stage, being freed from all 
material attachment, from the fearfulness of one’s individual spiritual personality, and 
from the frustrations that result in void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the 
abode of the Supreme Lord.

Translation 
As all  surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in 
all respects, O son of Pṛthā.  
Purport  
Everyone is searching for Kṛṣṇa in the different aspects of His manifestations. Kṛṣṇa, the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realize d in His impersonal  brahma -
jyotir  effulgence and as the all -pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including 
the particles of atoms. But Kṛṣṇa is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, Kṛṣṇa is the object of everyone’s realization , and thus anyone and everyone 
is satisfied according to one’s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, Kṛṣṇa 
reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee 
wants Him. One devotee may want Kṛṣṇa as supr eme master, another as his personal 
friend, another as his son and still another as his lover. Kṛṣṇa rewards all the devotees 
equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the 
same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with 
the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and 
thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists 
and who want to commit spiritual suicide b y annihilating the individual existence of the 
living entity, Kṛṣṇa helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists 
do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they 
cannot relish the bliss of tran scendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished 
their individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the impersonal 
existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitt ed into the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the 
material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the  yajñeśvara;  and those who are  yogīs  seeking mystic powers 
are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His 
mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the 
same path. Unless, t herefore, one comes to the highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, 
all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  (2.3.10) : 
akāmaḥ sarva- kāmo vā  
mokṣa -kāma udāra -dhīḥ 
tīvreṇ a bhakti -yogena  
yajeta puruṣaṁ param  
“Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous of all fruitive 
results or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try to worship the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead for complete perfection, culminating in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.”

According to the three modes of material nature and the work associated with them, 
the four divisions of human society are created b y Me. And although I am the 
creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the nondoer, being unchangeable.  
Purport  
The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation,  rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the 
four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically 
called  brāhmaṇas  due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the 
administrative class, technical ly called the  kṣatriyas  due to their being situated in the 
mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the  vaiśyas,  are situated in the mixed modes 
of passion and ignorance, and the  śūdras,  or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant 
mode of material na ture. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord 
Kṛṣṇa does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned 
souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other 
animal soc iety, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above -mentioned divisions 
are created by the Lord for the systematic development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The 
tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature 
which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the different modes of 
material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, however, is above even the  brāhmaṇas.  Although  brāhmaṇas  by quality 
are suppo sed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, most of them 
approach only the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord Kṛṣṇa. But a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a  brāhmaṇa and reaches the knowledge of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhe ad, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, becomes a person in Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness – or, in other words, a Vaiṣṇava. Kṛṣṇa consciousness includes knowledge 
of all different plenary expansions of Kṛṣṇa, namely Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha, etc. And as 
Kṛṣṇa is transcendental to this sys tem of the four divisions of human society, a person in 
Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.

Translation 
Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him 
submissively and render service unto him. The self -realized souls can im part 
knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth.  
Purport  
The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore advises us to 
approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord 
Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of 
disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic 
succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be 
spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish 
pretenders. The  Bhāgavatam  (6.3.19) says,  dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat -praṇītam:  the 
path of religion is directly e nunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry 
arguments cannot help lead one to the right path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual 
master to receive the  knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full 
surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false 
prestige. Satisfaction of the self -realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in 
spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual 
understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual mast er, and 
when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. Not only should one hear submissively from the spir itual master, but one 
must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A 
bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the 
student is submissive and is always ready to render ser vice, the reciprocation of 
knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.

Translation 
The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and 
gentle brāhmaṇa, a cow, an elephant , a dog and a dog -eater [outcaste].  
Purport  
A Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not make any distinction between species or castes. The brāhmaṇa and the outcaste may be different from the social point of view, or a dog, a 
cow and an elephant may be different fro m the point of view of species, but these 
differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a learned transcendentalist. This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary 
portion as Paramātmā, is present in ever yone’s heart. Such an understanding of the 
Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or 
different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every 
living being as a friend yet maintains H imself as Paramātmā regardless of the 
circumstances of the living entities. The Lord as Paramātmā is present both in the outcaste 
and in the  brāhmaṇa,  although the body of a  brāhmaṇa and that of an outcaste are not the 
same. The bodies are material product ions of different modes of material nature, but the 
soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in 
the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, 
for the individual sou l is present only in that particular body whereas the Paramātmā is 
present in each and every body. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person has full knowledge of this, and 
therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul 
and Supe rsoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the difference is 
that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body whereas the 
Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without 
distinction.

Translation 
An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due to 
contact with the material senses. O son of Kuntī, such pleasures have a beginning 
and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.  
Purport  
Material sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, which are all temporary because the body itself is temporary. A liberated soul is not interested in 
anything which is temporary. Knowing well the joys of transcendental pleasures, how can 
a liberated soul agree to enjoy false pleasure? In the  Padma Purāṇa it is said:  
ramante yogino ’nante  
satyānande cid- ātmani 
iti rāma -padenāsau 
paraṁ brahmābhidhīyate  
“The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth, and 
therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also known as 
Rāma.”  
In the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  also (5.5.1) it is said:  
nāyaṁ deho deha -bhājāṁ nṛ -loke 
kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ- bhujāṁ ye  
tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ  
śuddhyed yasmād brahma -saukh yaṁ tv anantam  
“My dear sons, there is no reason to labor very hard for sense pleasure while in this human 
form of life; such pleasures are available to the stool -eaters [hogs]. Rather, you should 
undergo penances in this life by which your existence will be purified, and as a result you 
will be able to enjoy unlimited transcendental bliss.”  
Therefore, those who are true  yogīs  or learned transcendentalists are not attracted by sense 
pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material existence. The more one is addicted 
to material pleasures, the more he is entrapped by material miseries.

A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate beneficiary of 
all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the 
benefactor and well -wisher of all living entities , attains peace from the pangs of 
material miseries.  
Purport  
The conditioned souls within the clutches of the illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is 
explained in this part  of the  Bhagavad -gītā. The greatest peace formula is simply this: 
Lord Kṛṣṇa is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the 
demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the 
demigods, Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. In the  Vedas  (Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.7) the 
Supreme Lord is described as  tam īśvarāṇāṁ paramaṁ maheśvaraṁ.  Under the spell of 
illusion, living entities ar e trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are 
dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, 
and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one 
understands these  bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either 
individua lly or collectively. This is the sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness: Lord Kṛṣṇa is the 
supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  
This Fift h Chapter is a practical explanation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, generally known 
as karma -yoga.  The question of mental speculation as to how karma- yoga  can give 
liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to work with the 
complete knowle dge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from 
transcendental knowledge. Direct Kṛṣṇa consciousness is  bhakti- yoga,  and jñāna- yoga  is a 
path leading to bhakti- yoga.  Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of 
one’s relation ship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is 
full knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the 
eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact 
with māyā (illusi on) due to the desire to lord it over  māyā,  and that is the cause of his 
many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms 
of material necessities. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even 
while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by 
practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the 
clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depe nds on one’s 
practical performance of duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And one who stands 
fast in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, controlling the abovementioned passions,  remains factually in 
the transcendental stage, or  brahma -nirvāṇa.  The eightfold  yoga  mysticism is 
automatically practiced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of  yama, niyam a, āsana, 
prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna  and samādhi.  But these only preface perfection 
by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.  
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Ch apter of the  Śrīmad Bhagavad -gītā in 
the matter of  Karma -yoga,  or Action in Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.

Translation 
He who is regulated in his habits of eating, sleeping, recreation and work can 
mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.  
Purport  
Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, def ending and mating –  which are demands 
of the body –  can block advancement in the practice of  yoga.  As far as eating is 
concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept  prasādam,  sanctified food. Lord Kṛṣṇa is offered, according to the  Bhagavad -
gītā (9.26) , vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human 
consumpti on, or not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a Kṛṣṇa 
conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and 
therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss.  Avyartha -
kālatvam:  a Kṛṣṇa conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being 
engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect is Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, who was always engaged in the servi ce of Kṛṣṇa 
and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that. Ṭhākura 
Haridāsa would not even accept  prasādam nor even sleep for a moment without finishing 
his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand na mes. As far as work 
is concerned, a Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with 
Kṛṣṇa’s interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense 
gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure 
for a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, 
sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him.

Translation 
The unsuccessful yogī, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the 
pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous  people, or into a family of rich 
aristocracy.  
Purport  
The unsuccessful  yogīs  are divided into two classes: one is fallen after very little progress, 
and one is fallen after long practice of  yoga.  The yogī who falls after a short period of 
practice goes to  the higher planets, where pious living entities are allowed to enter. After 
prolonged life there, one is sent back again to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous  brāhmaṇa  Vaiṣṇava or of aristocratic merchants.  
The real purpose of  yoga  practice is to achieve the highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, as explained in the last verse of this chapter. But those who do not 
persevere to such an extent and who fail because of material allurements are allowed, by 
the grace of the Lord, to make  full utilization of their material propensities. And after that, 
they are given opportunities to live prosperous lives in righteous or aristocratic families. 
Those who are born in such families may take advantage of the facilities and try to elevate 
thems elves to full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

always thinking of Me;  antaḥ- ātmanā  — within himself;  śraddhā- vān — in full

Translation 
And of all yogīs, the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me 
within himself and renders transcendental loving service to Me – he is the most 
intimately united with Me in yoga a nd is the highest of all. That is My opinion.  
Purport  
The word bhajate  is significant here.  Bhajate  has its root in the verb bhaj,  which is used 
when there is need of service. The English word “worship” cannot be used in the same 
sense as  bhaj.  Worship mea ns to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. 
But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called 
discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly 
condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, 
and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. 
Failing to do this,  he falls down. The  Bhāgavatam  (11.5.3) confirms this as follows:  
ya eṣāṁ puruṣaṁ sākṣād  
ātma -prabhavam īśvaram  
na bhajanty avajānanti  
sthānād bhraṣṭāḥ patanty adhaḥ 
“Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval Lord, who is the source of all li ving entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional 
position.”  
In this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore,  bhajanti is applicable to the 
Supreme Lord only, whereas the word “worship” can be applied to demigods or to any 
other commo n living entity. The word  avajānanti,  used in this verse of  Śrīmad -
Bhāgavatam,  is also found in the  Bhagavad -gītā. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ:  “Only the 
fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa.” Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the  Bhagavad -gītā without an attitude of 
service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly disting uish between the 
word  bhajanti and the word “worship.”  
The culmination of all kinds of  yoga  practices lies in  bhakti yoga.  All other  yogas  are but 
means to come to the point of  bhakti in bhakti- yoga. Yoga  actually means  bhakti -yoga;  all 
other  yogas  are pro gressions toward the destination of  bhakti- yoga.  From the beginning 
of karma -yoga  to the end of  bhakti -yoga  is a long way to self -realization.  Karma -
yoga,  without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When karma -yoga  increases in 
knowledge and r enunciation, the stage is called  jñāna- yoga.  When  jñāna -yoga  increases in 
meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is 
called  aṣṭāṅga -yoga.  And when one surpasses the  aṣṭāṅga -yoga  and comes to the point of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, it is called  bhakti -yoga,  the culmination. 
Factually,  bhakti -yoga  is the ultimate goal, but to analyze  bhakti -yoga  minutely one has to 
understand these other  yogas.  The yogī who is progressive is therefore on the true path of 
eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name:  karma -yogī, jñāna -yogī or dhyāna- yogī, rāja-
yogī, haṭha- yogī,  etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of  bhakti- yoga,  it is 
to be understood that he has surpassed all other  yogas.  Therefore, to become Kṛṣṇa 
conscious is the highest stage of  yoga,  just as, when we speak of Himālayan, we refer to 
the world’s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to 
be the culmination.  
It is by great fortune that one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness on the path of  bhakti- yoga  to 
become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal  yogī concentrates his 
attention on Kṛṣṇa, who is called Śyāmasundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, 
whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels, and 
whose body is flower -garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is 
called the  brahma -jyotir. He incarnates in different forms such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha 
and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of mother Yaśodā, and He is known as Kṛṣṇa, Govinda and Vāsudeva. He is the 
perfect child, hus band, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and 
transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is 
called the highest  yogī.  
This stage of highest perfection in yoga  can be attained only by bhakti -yoga, as is 
confirmed in all Vedic literature:  
yasya deve parā bhaktir  
yathā deve tathā gurau  
tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ  
prakāśante mahātmanaḥ  
“Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual 
master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.” ( Śvetāśvatara 
Upaniṣad 6.23)  
Bhaktir asya bhajanaṁ tad ihāmutropādhi -nairāsyenāmuṣmin manaḥ -kalpanam, etad eva 
naiṣkarmyam.  “Bhakti  means devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for 
material prof it, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should 
fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the purpose of  naiṣkarmya. ” (Gopāla- tāpanī 
Upaniṣad 1.15)  
These are some of the means for performance of  bhakti,  or Kṛṣṇa consciou sness, the 
highest perfectional stage of the  yoga  system.  
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the  Śrīmad Bhagavad -gītā in 
the matter of  Dhyāna -yoga.

Translation 
Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those 
who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me  in truth.  
Purport  
There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands, one may be sufficiently 
interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, 
and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply e ngaged in the animal 
propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is 
interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the  Gītā are meant for 
those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the 
Superself and the process of realization by  jñāna -yoga, dhyāna -yoga  and discrimination of 
the self from matter. However, Kṛṣṇa can be known only by pers ons who are in Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for 
this is easier than understanding Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person, but at the same time 
He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Paramātmā. The  yogīs  and jñānīs  are 
confused in their attempts to understand Kṛṣṇa. Although the greatest of the 
impersonalists, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, has admitted in his  Gītā commentary that Kṛṣṇa is 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his followers do not accept Kṛṣṇa  as such, for it is 
very difficult to know Kṛṣṇa, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.  
Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord 
Govinda.  Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac -cid-ānanda -vigrahaḥ/ anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva -
kāraṇa -kāraṇam.  It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although 
nondevotees declare that the path of  bhakti,  or devotional service, is very easy, they 
cannot practice it. If the path of  bhakti  is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men 
proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of  bhakti is not 
easy. The so -called path of  bhakti  practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge 
of bhakti  may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and 
regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. Śrīla Rūpa 
Gosvāmī writes in his  Bhakti- rasāmṛta -sindhu  (1.2.101):  
śruti-smṛti -purāṇādi-  
pañcarātra- vidhiṁ vinā 
aikāntikī harer bhaktir  
utpātāyaiva kalpate  
“Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like 
the Upaniṣads, Purāṇas  and Nārada Pañcarātra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in 
society.”  
It is not possible for the Brahman -realized impersonalist or the Paramātmā -realized  yogī to 
understand Kṛṣṇa the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Yaśodā or the 
charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about Kṛṣṇa 
(muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ ). Māṁ tu veda na kaścana:  “No one knows Me as I am,” the Lord 
says. And if one does know Him, then sa mahātmā su- durlabhaḥ:  “Such a great soul is 
very rare.” Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one cannot know 
Kṛṣṇa as He is ( tattvataḥ ), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the 
pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in Kṛṣṇa 
– His being the cause of all causes, His omnipotence and opulence, and His wealth, fame, 
strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation – because Kṛṣṇa is benevolently inclined to 
His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:  
ataḥ śrī -kṛṣṇa -nāmādi  
na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ  
sevonmukhe hi jihvādau  
svayam eva  sphuraty adaḥ 
“No one can understand Kṛṣṇa as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals 
Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service 
unto Him.” ( Bhakti- rasāmṛta- sindhu  1.2.234)

Translation 
Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego – all together these e ight 
constitute My separated material energies.  
Purport  
The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse energies. 
Material nature is called  prakṛti,  or the energy of the Lord in His 
different  puruṣa  incarnations (expansions) as described in the  Nārada Pañcarātra,  one of 
the Sātvata- tantras:  
viṣṇos tu trīṇi rūpāṇi  
puruṣākhyāny atho viduḥ  
ekaṁ tu mahataḥ sraṣṭṛ  
dvitīyaṁ tv aṇḍa -saṁsthitam  
tṛtīyaṁ sarva -bhūta- sthaṁ  
tāni jñātvā vimucyate  
“For material creation, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s plenar y expansion assumes three Viṣṇus. The first 
one, Mahā -viṣṇu, creates the total material energy, known as the  mahat- tattva.  The 
second, Garbhodaka -śāyī Viṣṇu, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each 
of them. The third, Kṣīrodaka -śāyī Viṣ ṇu, is diffused as the all -pervading Supersoul in all 
the universes and is known as Paramātmā. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone 
who knows these three Viṣṇus can be liberated from material entanglement.”  
This material world is a temporary manifes tation of one of the energies of the Lord. All 
the activities of the material world are directed by these three Viṣṇu expansions of Lord Kṛṣṇa. These  puruṣas  are called incarnations. Generally one who does not know the 
science of God (Kṛṣṇa) assumes that t his material world is for the enjoyment of the living 
entities and that the living entities are the  puruṣas  – the causes, controllers and enjoyers of 
the material energy. According to Bhagavad- gītā this at heistic conclusion is false. In the 
verse under discussion it is stated that Kṛṣṇa is the original cause of the material 
manifestation.  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  also confirms this. The ingredients of the material  
manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the  brahma -jyotir,  which is the 
ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the  brahma -jyotir  as there are in the Vaikuṇṭha -lokas, 
and the impersonalist accepts this  brahma -jyotir  as the ultimate eternal goal. The 
Paramātmā manifestation is also a temporary all -pervasive aspect of the Kṣīrodaka -śāyī 
Viṣṇu. The Paramātmā manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual wo rld. Therefore the 
factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.  
In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above  mentioned. Out of 
these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included. 
They are the manifestations of physical sound,  touch, form, taste and smell. Material 
science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely 
mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal 
with mental activities are also not per fect in knowledge because they do not know the 
ultimate source, Kṛṣṇa. The false ego – “I am,” and “It is mine,” which constitute the basic 
principle of material existence – includes ten sense organs for material activities. 
Intelligence refers to the tota l material creation, called the  mahat- tattva.  Therefore from 
the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty -four elements of the 
material world, which are the subject matter of Sāṅkhya atheistic philosophy; they are 
originally offshoots f rom Kṛṣṇa’s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic 
Sāṅkhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know Kṛṣṇa as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the Sāṅkhya philosophy is only the manifestation of the ext ernal energy of Kṛṣṇa, as it is described in the  Bhagavad- gītā.

Translation 
Besides these, O mighty -armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, 
which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, 
inferior nature.  
Purport  
Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature (or energy) of 
the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements, namely 
earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. Both forms of material 
nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior 
energy. The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for di fferent 
purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the 
entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is 
moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are al ways controlled by the 
energetic, and therefore the living entities are always controlled by the Lord –  they have 
no independent existence. They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men think. 
The distinction between the living entities and the Lor d is described in Śrīmad -
Bhāgavatam (10.87.30)  as follows:  
aparimitā dhruvās tanu -bhṛto yadi sarva -gatās  
tarhi na śāsyateti niyamo dhruva netarathā  
ajani ca yan- mayaṁ tad avimucya niyantṛ bhavet  
samam anujānatāṁ yad amataṁ mata- duṣṭatayā  
“O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied  living entities were eternal and all -pervading like 
You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the living entities are accepted as 
minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control. 
Therefore real liberati on entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that 
surrender will make them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be 
controllers. Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that 
God and the livi ng entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by a faulty and 
polluted opinion.”  
The Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by 
Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is 
one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of 
power. While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy 
(the living entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and i ntelligence. This forgetfulness is due 
to the influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes free 
from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called  mukti,  or 
liberation. The false ego, under the  influence of material illusion, thinks, “I am matter, and 
material acquisitions are mine.” His actual position is realized when he is liberated from 
all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. 
Therefore one m ay conclude that the  Gītā confirms the living entity to be only one of the 
multi -energies of Kṛṣṇa; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it 
becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, or liberated.

O conqueror of wealth, there is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me,

Purport  
There is a comm on controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or 
impersonal. As far as  Bhagavad -gītā is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of 
Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and this is confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is 
stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the  Brahma -saṁhitā: īśvaraḥ paramaḥ 
kṛṣṇaḥ sac -cid-ānanda -vigrahaḥ;  that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of 
Godhead is Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, 
and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt 
that the Absolute Truth is the Su preme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, 
however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the  Śvetāśvatara 
Upaniṣad (3.10):  tato yad uttara- taraṁ tad arūpam anāmayam/ ya etad vidur amṛtās te 
bhavanti athetare duḥkham evāpiyant i. “In the material world Brahmā, the primeval living 
entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human 
beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahmā there is the Transcendence, who has no 
material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the 
material world.”  
The impersonalist puts more stress on the word arūpam.  But this  arūpam  is not 
impersonal. It indicat es the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as 
described in the  Brahma -saṁhitā  quoted above. Other verses in the  Śvetāśvatara 
Upaniṣad (3.8–9) substantiate this as follows:  
vedāham etaṁ puruṣaṁ mahāntam  
āditya -varṇaṁ tamasaḥ parastāt  
tam ev a viditvāti mṛtyum eti  
nānyaḥ panthā vidyate ’yanāya  
yasmāt paraṁ nāparam asti kiñcid  
yasmān nāṇīyo no jyāyo ’sti kiñcit  
vṛkṣa iva stabdho divi tiṣṭhaty ekas  
tenedaṁ pūrṇaṁ puruṣeṇa sarvam  
“I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental t o all material 
conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds of birth and 
death. There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that Supreme Person.  
“There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person, because He is the  supermost. He is 
smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest. He is situated as a silent tree, 
and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies.”  
From these verses one concludes  that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, who is all -pervading by His multi -energies, both material and 
spiritual.

Translation 
This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is 
difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross 
beyond it.  
Purport  
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has  innumerable energies, and all these energies are 
divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to 
contact with material energy their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered 
by material energy, o ne cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both 
the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, 
but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The 
conditioned soul is therefore called  nitya -baddha,  or eternally conditioned. No one can 
trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material his tory. 
Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even 
though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately 
conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material 
nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the 
divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so 
wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosm ic manifestation. 
The Vedas  confirm this as follows:  māyāṁ tu prakṛtiṁ vidyān māyinaṁ tu 
maheśvaram.  “Although māyā  [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of  māyā  is 
the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Maheśvara, the supreme 
controller.” ( Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 4.10)  
Another meaning of  guṇa  is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly 
tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself –  he 
must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, 
the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord Kṛṣṇa, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one 
cannot be freed from the  bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, can help one gain such release. Kṛṣṇa, being the Lord of the illusory 
energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders 
this release out of His c auseless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal 
affection for the living entity, who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore 
surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringen t material nature.  
The words  mām eva  are also significant.  Mām  means unto Kṛṣṇa (Viṣṇu) only, and not 
Brahmā or Śiva. Although Brahmā and Śiva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Viṣṇu, it is not possible for such incarnations of  rajo-guṇa (passion) and  tamo -
guṇa  (igno rance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of  māyā.  In other 
words, both Brahmā and Śiva are also under the influence of  māyā.  Only Viṣṇu is the 
master of  māyā;  therefore He alone can give release to the conditioned soul. 
The Vedas  (Śvetāśvat ara Upaniṣad 3.8) confirm this in the phrase  tam eva viditvā,  or 
“Freedom is possible only by understanding Kṛṣṇa.” Even Lord Śiva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Viṣṇu. Lord Śiva says,  mukti -pradātā 
sarveṣāṁ viṣṇur eva na saṁś ayaḥ:  “There is no doubt that Viṣṇu is the deliverer of 
liberation for everyone.”

Purport  
It is said in  Bhagavad -gītā that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the 
Supreme Personality Kṛṣṇa one can surmount the stringent laws of material nat ure. At this 
point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, 
administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of Śrī 
Kṛṣṇa, the all -powerful Personality of Godhead?  Mukti,  or libe ration from the laws of 
material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans 
and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by 
simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Sup reme Personality of Godhead, then why 
don’t these intelligent and hard -working leaders adopt this simple method?  
The Gītā answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like 
Brahmā, Śiva, Kapila, the Kumāras, Manu, Vyāsa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, Prahlāda, Bali, 
and later on Madhvācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Śrī Caitanya and many others – who are 
faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc. – surrender to the lotus feet of 
the Supreme Person, the all -powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, 
scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as s uch for material 
gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they 
simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of 
material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Becaus e material energy (nature) is 
so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of “planning commissions.”  
The atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word  duṣkṛtinaḥ,  or 
“miscreants.”  Kṛtī means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist planmaker 
is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, 
must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist’s b rain is improperly utilized in 
opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called duṣkṛtī,  which 
indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.  
In the  Gītā it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under t he direction of 
the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves, in 
accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, 
and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it  works; nor can he 
know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and 
ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hiraṇyakaśipu and Rāvaṇa, whose 
plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These  duṣkṛtinas,  or miscreants, are of four 
different patterns, as outlined below.  
(1) The  mūḍhas  are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of burden. 
They want to enjoy the fruit s of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with 
them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble 
beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he 
works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of 
grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex 
appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poe try 
and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not 
know that  karma  (action) is meant for  yajña (sacrifice).  
Most often, those  who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self -created 
duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To 
such mūḍhas,  material gains, which are destructible, are life’s all in all –  despite the fact 
that the  mūḍhas  enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they 
spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ul cers or 
indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in 
working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real 
master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfor tunately, 
they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of 
Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to accept 
sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue 
to hear of the sense -enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane world, but will have very 
little time to hear about the eternal living force that moves the material world.  
(2) Another class of  duṣkṛtī,  or miscreant, is called the  narādhama,  or the lowest of 
mankind.  Nara  means human being, and adhama  means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 
different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivil ized. The civilized human 
beings are those who have regulative principles of social, political and religious life. 
Those who are socially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be considered narādhamas.  Nor is religion without God religion, because the 
purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man’s relation with Him. In the  Gītā the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority 
above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant 
for man’s  reviving the lost consciousness  of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, 
the Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is all -powerful. Whoever loses this chance is 
class ified as a  narādhama.  We get information from revealed scriptures that when the 
baby is in the mother’s womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for 
deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God 
when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally 
related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by māyā,  the illusory energy . 
It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the  Manu -smṛti,  which 
is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousne ss in the 
system of  varṇāśrama.  However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the 
world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is  narādhama.  
When the whole population becomes  narādhama,  naturally all their so -called education is 
made n ull and void by the all -powerful energy of physical nature. According to the 
standard of the  Gītā,  a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the 
learned  brāhmaṇa,  the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog- eater. That is the vision of a 
true devotee. Śrī  Nityānanda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, 
delivered the typical  narādhamas,  the brothers Jagāi and Mādhāi, and showed how the 
mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the  narādhama  who 
is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness 
only by the mercy of a devotee.  
Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in propagating the  bhāgavata- dharma,  or activities of the 
devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality 
of Godhead. The essence of this message is  Bhagavad -gītā. The lowest amongst human 
beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they 
even refuse to give an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of 
surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord?  Narādhamas,  or the lowest of mankind, 
willfully neglect the prime duty of the human being.  
(3) The next class of  duṣkṛtī  is called  māyayāpahṛta- jñānāḥ,  or those persons whose 
erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy. They 
are mostly very learned fellows – great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc. – but 
the illusory energy misguides them, and there fore they disobey the Supreme Lord.  
There are a great number of  māyayāpahṛta -jñānāḥ  at the present moment, even amongst 
the scholars of the  Bhagavad -gītā. In the  Gītā,  in plain and simple language, it is s tated 
that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none equal to or greater 
than Him. He is mentioned as the father of Brahmā, the original father of all human 
beings. In fact, Śrī Kṛṣṇa is said to be not only the father of Brahmā but als o the father of 
all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Paramātmā; the Supersoul 
in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone 
is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all t hese clear statements, 
the māyayāpahṛta -jñānāḥ  deride the personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him 
merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life is 
designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supr eme Lord.  
All the unauthorized interpretations of the  Gītā by the class of  māyayāpahṛta -
jñānāḥ,  outside the purview of the  paramparā  system, are so many stumbling blocks on 
the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the 
lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, nor do they teach others to follow this principle.  
(4) The last class of  duṣkṛtī  is called  āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ,  or those of demonic 
principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can 
never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons 
as to why not. There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, 
although the opposite is declared in the  Gītā.  Envious of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the 
factory of his brain. Such persons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead, cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.  
Śrī Yāmunācāry a Ālabandaru of South India said, “O my Lord! You are unknowable to 
persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Your uncommon qualities, features and 
activities, despite Your personality’s being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the 
quality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the 
godly qualities.”  
Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) t he deluded 
speculators and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.

Translation 
O best among the Bhāratas, four kinds of pious men begin to render devotional 
service unto Me –  the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is 
searching for knowledge of the Absolute.  
Purport  
Unlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the scriptures, 
and they are called  su-kṛtinaḥ,  or those who obey the rules and regulations of scriptures, 
the moral and social laws, and are, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of 
these there are four classes of men – those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in 
need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Sup reme 
Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees, 
because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure 
devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit.  The Bhakti -
rasāmṛta -sindhu  (1.1.11) defines pure devotion thus:  
anyābhilāṣitā -śūnyaṁ  
jñāna -karmādy -anāvṛtam  
ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-  
śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā  
“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa favorably 
and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical 
speculation. That is called pure devotional service.”  
When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and 
are completely purified by the association o f a pure devotee, they also become pure 
devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very 
difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. But even 
some of them, by chance, when they come  in contact with a pure devotee, also become 
pure devotees.  
Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress 
and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their distress, devotees of the 
Lord. Those wh o are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure 
devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers 
are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they 
come to  the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of 
the impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramātmā and come to the personal 
conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the 
whole, when the di stressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are 
in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure 
devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental 
service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, the search for mundane knowledge, 
etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotiona l 
service.

Translation 
After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, 
knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Su ch a great soul is very 
rare.  
Purport  
The living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, 
many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ulti mate goal of spiritual realization. In the 
beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one’s attachment to 
materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further 
advanced he can understand that there are ac tivities in the spiritual life and that these 
activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can 
understand that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s mercy is everyt hing, that He is the cause of all causes, 
and that this material manifestation is not independent from Him. He realizes the material 
world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in 
everything there is a relationship with  the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa. Thus he thinks of 
everything in relation to Vāsudeva, or Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Such a universal vision of Vāsudeva 
precipitates one’s full surrender to the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the highest goal. Such 
surrendered great souls are very rare . 
This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and 15) of 
the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad:  
sahasra -śīrṣā puruṣaḥ  
sahasrākṣaḥ sahasra- pāt 
sa bhūmiṁ viśvato vṛtvā-  
tyātiṣṭhad daśāṅgulam  
puruṣa evedaṁ sarvaṁ  
yad bhūtaṁ yac ca bhavyam  
utāmṛtat vasyeśāno  
yad annenātirohati  
“Lord Viṣṇu has thousands of heads, thousands of eyes and thousands of feet. Entirely 
encompassing the whole universe, He still extends beyond it by ten fingers’ breadth. He is 
in fact this entire universe. He is all that was a nd all that will be. He is the Lord of 
immortality and of all that is nourished by food.” In the  Chāndogya Upaniṣad  (5.1.15) it is 
said, na vai vāco na cakṣūṁṣi na śrotrāṇi na manāṁsīty ācakṣate prāṇa iti evācakṣate 
prāṇo hy evaitāni sarvāṇi bhavanti:  “In the body of a living being neither the power to 
speak, nor the power to see, nor the power to hear, nor the power to think is the prime factor; it is life which is the center of all activities.” Similarly Lord Vāsudeva, or the Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is the prime entity in everything. In this body 
there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But these are 
not important if not related to the Supreme Lord. And because Vāsudeva is all -pervading 
and everything is Vāsudeva, the devotee surrenders in full knowledge (cf.  Bhagavad -
gītā 7.17 and 11.40).

Translation 
I am never manifest to t he foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My 
internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible.  
Purport  
It may be argued that since Kṛṣṇa was visible to everyone when He was present on this 
earth, how can it be s aid that He is not manifest to everyone? But actually He was not 
manifest to everyone. When Kṛṣṇa was present there were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, 
when Śiśupāla spoke agai nst Kṛṣṇa’s being elected president of the assembly, Bhīṣma 
supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pāṇḍavas and a 
few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the 
nondevotees and the comm on man. Therefore in the  Bhagavad -gītā Kṛṣṇa says that but for 
His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, 
He was covered by His internal potency.  
In the prayers of Kuntī in the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam (1.8.19)  it is said that the Lord is 
covered by the curtain of  yoga -māyā  and thus ordinary people cannot understand Him. 
This yoga -māyā  curtain is also confirmed in the  Īśopaniṣad  (Mantra 15), in which the 
devotee prays:  
hiraṇmayena pātreṇa  
satyasyāpihitaṁ mukham  
tat tvaṁ pūṣann apāvṛṇu  
satya -dharmāya dṛṣṭaye  
“O my Lord, You a re the maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional service to You 
is the highest religious principle. Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your 
transcendental form is covered by the  yoga- māyā.  The brahma- jyotir  is the covering of the 
internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing 
Your  sac-cid-ānanda -vigraha,  Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge.” The Supreme 
Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of the  brahma -jyotir,  and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see 
the Supreme on this account.  
Also in the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  (10.14.7)  there is this prayer by Brahmā: “O Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your 
potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned scholar s can examine 
the atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency, although You are present before them.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, is not only unborn but 
also avyaya,  inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and His energies are 
all inexhaustible.

Translation 
O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has 
happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet 
to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one know s. 
Purport  
Here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If Kṛṣṇa, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were  māyā,  material, as the impersonalists consider 
Him to be, then like the living entity He would change His body a nd forget everything 
about His past life. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he 
foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from 
material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.  
Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Kṛṣṇa clearly says that He completely knows what 
happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future. 
In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord Kṛṣṇa remembers instructing Viva svān, the 
sun-god, millions of years ago. Kṛṣṇa knows every living entity because He is situated in 
every living being’s heart as the Supersoul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presence as the Supreme Personality of God head, the less intelligent, 
even if able to realize the impersonal Brahman, cannot realize Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme 
Person. Certainly the transcendental body of Śrī Kṛṣṇa is not perishable. He is just like the 
sun, and  māyā  is like a cloud. In the material  world we can see that there is the sun and 
that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the 
sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon 
and stars are not actually cov ered. Similarly,  māyā  cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By 
His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated 
in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become 
perfect in this human form of l ife, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected 
men, hardly one can understand what Lord Kṛṣṇa is. Even if one is perfected by 
realization of impersonal Brahman or localized Paramātmā, he cannot possibly understand 
the Supreme Personality of Godh ead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, without being in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Translation 
O scion of Bharata, O conqueror of the foe, all living entities a re born into delusion, 
bewildered by dualities arisen from desire and hate.  
Purport  
The real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordination to the Supreme 
Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one is deluded into separation from this pur e 
knowledge, he becomes controlled by the illusory energy and cannot understand the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of 
desire and hate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become one with the  
Supreme Lord and envies Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure devotees, 
who are not deluded or contaminated by desire and hate, can understand that Lord Śrī 
Kṛṣṇa appears by His internal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality and 
nescience think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by material energies. 
This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons, symptomatically, dwell in dualities of 
dishonor and honor, misery and happiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and 
pain, etc., thinking, “This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of this house; I am 
the husband of this wife.” These are the dualities of delusion. Those who are so deluded 
by dualities are completely foolish and therefore cannot understand the S upreme 
Personality of Godhead.

determination.  
Translation 
Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life a nd whose sinful 
actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they 
engage themselves in My service with determination.  
Purport  
Those eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the 
duality of desire and hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing the 
regulative principles of religion, who have acted piously, and who have conquer ed sinful 
reactions can accept devotional service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the process of being situated on t he spiritual 
platform. This elevation is possible in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the association of pure devotees, for in the association of great devotees one can be delivered from delusion.  
It is stated in the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam (5.5.2)  that if one actually wants to be liberated he 
must render service to the devotees ( mahat- sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ); but one who 
associates with materialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of 
existen ce (tamo -dvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgi -saṅgam ). All the devotees of the Lord traverse this 
earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion. The impersonalists do not 
know that forgetting their constitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lo rd is the 
greatest violation of God’s law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional position, 
it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality or to be fully engaged in His 
transcendental loving service with determination.

Translation 
And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once 
attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.  
Purport  
In this verse the importance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is stressed. Anyone who quits his body in Kṛṣṇa c onsciousness is at once transferred to the transcendental nature of the 
Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the purest of the pure. Therefore anyone who is constantly Kṛṣṇa conscious is also the purest of the pure. The word  smaran  (“remembering”) is importan t. Remembrance of Kṛṣṇa is not possible for the 
impure soul who has not practiced Kṛṣṇa consciousness in devotional service. Therefore 
one should practice Kṛṣṇa consciousness from the very beginning of life. If one wants to 
achieve success at the end of hi s life, the process of remembering Kṛṣṇa is essential. 
Therefore one should constantly, incessantly chant the  mahā -mantra  – Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare 
Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Lord 
Caitanya has advised that one be as  tolerant as a tree ( taror api sahiṣṇunā ). There may be 
so many impediments for a person who is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Nonetheless, tolerating all 
these impediments, one should continue to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, 
Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare  Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, so that at the end of one’s 
life one can have the full benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

that; bhāva — state of being;  bhāvitaḥ  — remembering.  
Translation 
Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kuntī, that state he will at tain without fail.  
Purport  
The process of changing one’s nature at the critical moment of death is here explained. A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking of Kṛṣṇa attains the 
transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true that a person who thinks of 
something other than Kṛṣṇa attains the same transcendental state. This is a point we should 
note very carefully. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Mahārāja Bharata, although a great personality, thought of a deer at  the end of his life, and so in his next life 
he was transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his past activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one’s thoughts during the course of one’s life accumulate to influ ence one’s thoughts at the moment of death, so this life 
creates one’s next life. If in one’s present life one lives in the mode of goodness and 
always thinks of Kṛṣṇa, it is possible for one to remember Kṛṣṇa at the end of one’s life. 
That will help one b e transferred to the transcendental nature of Kṛṣṇa. If one is 
transcendentally absorbed in Kṛṣṇa’s service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not material. Therefore the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, 
Hare Hare/ Hare  Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare is the best process for 
successfully changing one’s state of being at the end of one’s life.

same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting. With your activities dedicated 
to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me wi thout doubt.  
Purport  
This instruction to Arjuna is very important for all men engaged in material activities. The Lord does not say that one should give up his prescribed duties or engagements. One can 
continue them and at the same time think of Kṛṣṇa by c hanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. This will free 
one from material contamination and engage the mind and intelligence in Kṛṣṇa. By 
chanting Kṛṣṇa’s names, one will be transferred to the supreme planet, Kṛṣṇaloka, without 
a doubt.

Translation 
For one who always remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of 
Pṛthā, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.  
 
Purport  
This verse especially describes th e final destination attained by the unalloyed devotees 
who serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead in bhakti- yoga.  Previous verses have 
mentioned four different kinds of devotees – the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek 
material gain, and the spe culative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also 
been described:  karma -yoga, jñāna -yoga  and haṭha -yoga.  The principles of 
these  yoga  systems have some  bhakti added, but this verse particularly mentions 
pure bhakti -yoga,  without any mixture of  jñāna, karma  or haṭha.  As indicated by the 
word  ananya- cetāḥ,  in pure  bhakti- yoga the devotee desires nothing but Kṛṣṇa. A pure 
devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with 
the brahma -jyotir  or salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee 
does not desire anything. In the  Caitanya -caritāmṛta  the pure devotee is 
called  niṣkāma,  which means he has no desire for self -interest. Perfect peace belongs to 
him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas a  jñāna -yogī, karma-
yogī or haṭha- yogī has his own selfish interes ts, a perfect devotee has no desire other than 
to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone 
who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.  
A pure devotee always engages in devotional service to Kṛṣṇa in one of His various 
personal features. Kṛṣṇa has various plenary expansions and incarnations, such as Rāma and Nṛsiṁha, and a devotee can choose to fix his mind in loving service to any of these 
transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee meets  with none of the 
problems that plague the practitioners of other  yogas. Bhakti- yoga  is very simple and pure 
and easy to perform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. The Lord is merciful to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially i nclined toward those who 
always serve Him without deviation. The Lord helps such devotees in various ways. As 
stated in the  Vedas  (Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.2.23),  yam evaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas/ tasyaiṣa 
ātmā vivṛṇute tanuṁ svām:  one who is fully surrendered and e ngaged in the devotional 
service of the Supreme Lord can understand the Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated 
in Bhagavad- gītā (10.10) , dadāmi buddhi -yogaṁ tam:  the Lord gives such a devotee 
sufficien t intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual 
kingdom.  
The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa without 
deviation and without considering the time or place. There should be no impe diments. He 
should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like Vṛndāvana or some holy town where the Lord 
lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of Vṛ ndāvana by 
his devotional service. It was Śrī Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, “Wherever You are, O 
Lord – there  is Vṛndāvana.”  
As indicated by the words  satatam and nityaśaḥ,  which mean “always,” “regularly,” or 
“every day,” a pure devotee constantly remem bers Kṛṣṇa and meditates upon Him. These 
are qualifications of the pure devotee, for whom the Lord is most easily attainable.  Bhakti -
yoga  is the system that the  Gītā recommends above all others. Generally, the  bhakti -
yogīs  are engaged in five different ways: (1)  śānta -bhakta,  engaged in devotional service 
in neutrality; (2)  dāsya -bhakta,  engaged in devotional service as servant; (3)  sakhya -
bhakta,  engaged as friend; (4)  vātsalya -bhakta,  engaged as parent; and (5)  mādhurya -
bhakta,  engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure 
devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme 
Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A 
pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme 
Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the Kṛṣṇa 
conscious process of chanting the  mahā -mantra  – Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, 
Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

Translation  
After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogīs in devotion, never return to this 
temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest 
perfection.  
Purport  
Since this temporary material world is full of the miseries of  birth, old age, disease and 
death, naturally he who achieves the highest perfection and attains the supreme planet, 
Kṛṣṇaloka, Goloka Vṛndāvana, does not wish to return. The supreme planet is described in 
Vedic literature as  avyakta  and akṣara  and paramā gati;  in other words, that planet is 
beyond our material vision, and it is inexplicable, but it is the highest goal, the destination 
for the  mahātmās  (great souls). The  mahātmās  receive transcendental messages from the 
realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness 
and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to 
any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet. 
They only want Kṛṣṇa an d Kṛṣṇa’s association, and nothing else. That is the highest 
perfection of life. This verse specifically mentions the personalist devotees of the Supreme 
Lord, Kṛṣṇa. These devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness achieve the highest perfection of life. 
In other wo rds, they are the supreme souls.

Translation 
From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of 
misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who at tains to My 
abode, O son of Kuntī, never takes birth again.  
Purport  
All kinds of  yogīs – karma, jñāna, haṭha,  etc. – eventually have to attain devotional 
perfection in  bhakti- yoga,  or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, before they can go to Kṛṣṇa’s 
transcendental abode and never return. Those who attain the highest material planets, the 
planets of the demigods, are again subjected to repeated birth and death. As persons on 
earth are elevated to higher planets, people on higher planets such as Brahmaloka, 
Candraloka and Indra loka fall down to earth. The practice of sacrifice called  pañcāgni-
vidyā,  recommended in the  Chāndogya Upaniṣad,  enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but 
if, on Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness on the higher planets are g radually 
elevated to higher and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are 
transferred to the eternal spiritual kingdom. Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, in his commentary 
on Bhagavad- gītā, quotes this verse:  
brahmaṇā saha te sarve  
samprāpte pratisañcare  
parasyānte kṛtātmānaḥ  
praviśanti paraṁ padam  
“When there is devastation of this material universe, Brahmā and his devotees, who are 
constantly engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, are all transferred to t he spiritual universe and 
to specific spiritual planets according to their desires.”

Translation 
A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results 
derived from studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices, undergoing austerities, 
giving charity or pursuing philos ophical and fruitive activities. Simply by performing 
devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal 
abode.  
Purport  
This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth chapters, which particularly deal with Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the  Vedas  under the 
guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living 
under his care. A  brahmacārī  has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a 
servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He 
takes food only under the master’s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for 
food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for  
observing brahmacarya.  
After the student studies the  Vedas  under the master for some time – at least from age five 
to twenty – he becomes a man of perfect character. Study of the  Vedas  is not meant for the 
recreation of armchair speculators, but for the f ormation of character. After this training, 
the brahmacārī  is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a 
householder, he has to perform many sacrifices so that he may achieve further enlightenment. He must also give charity according to t he country, time and candidate, 
discriminating among charity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described 
in Bhagavad- gītā. Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order 
of vānaprastha,  he undergoes severe penances –  living in forests, dressing with tree bark, 
not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of  brahmacarya,  householder 
life, vānaprastha and finally  sannyāsa,  one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of 
life. S ome are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more 
advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal  brahma- jyotir  or 
in the Vaikuṇṭha planets or Kṛṣṇaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures . 
The beauty of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in 
devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different orders of life.  
The words  idaṁ viditvā  indicate that one should understand the instructions given by Śr ī 
Kṛṣṇa in this chapter and the Seventh Chapter of  Bhagavad -gītā. One should try to 
understand these chapters not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in 
association with devotees. Chap ters Seven through Twelve are the essence of  Bhagavad -
gītā. The first six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, 
which are especially protected by the Lord. If one is for tunate enough to 
understand Bhagavad -gītā – especially these middle six chapters –  in the association of 
devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, specul ations, etc., for one can achieve all the results of these activities simply by Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness.  
One who has a little faith in  Bhagavad -gītā should learn Bhagavad -gītā from a devotee, 
because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly that  Bhagavad- gītā can 
be understood only by devotees; no one else can perfectly understand the purpose  
of Bhagavad -gītā. One should therefore learn  Bhagavad -gītā from a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, not 
from mental speculators. This is a sign of faith. When one search es for a devotee and 
fortunately gets a devotee’s association one actually begins to study and 
understand Bhagavad -gītā. By advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed 
in devotional service , and this service dispels all one’s misgivings about Kṛṣṇa, or God, 
and Kṛṣṇa’s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these misgivings 
have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one’s study. Then one relishes the 
study of  Bhagavad- gītā and attains the state of feeling always Kṛṣṇa conscious. In the 
advanced stage, one falls completely in love with Kṛṣṇa. This highest perfectional stage of 
life enables the devotee to be tran sferred to Kṛṣṇa’s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka 
Vṛndāvana, where the devotee becomes eternally happy.  
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the  Śrīmad Bhagavad -
gītā in the matt er of Attaining the Supreme.

Translation 
This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest 
knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the 
perfection of religion. I t is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.  
Purport  
This chapter of  Bhagavad -gītā is called the king of education because it is the essence of 
all doctrines and philosophies explained before. Among the  principal philosophers in India 
are Gautama, Kaṇāda, Kapila, Yājñavalkya, Śāṇḍilya and Vaiśvānara. And finally there is 
Vyāsadeva, the author of the  Vedānta- sūtra.  So there is no dearth of knowledge in the 
field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth 
Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the  Vedas  and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most 
confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the 
difference between the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge 
culminates in devotional service.  
Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are educated in 
external kno wledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with 
so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and 
many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution 
where the science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part of 
the body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value. Still people are placing 
great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul.  
The Bhagavad -gītā, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the 
soul. In the very begi nning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is 
not perishable ( antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ ). That is a confidential part of 
knowledge: simply knowing that the spirit soul is different from this body and that its 
nature  is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive information 
about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul 
remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, an d its activities in the 
spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.  
This k nowledge is the purest form of all activities, as explained in Vedic literature. In 
the Padma Purāṇa,  man’s sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the 
results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in 
different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For instance, when the seed of a particular 
tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a 
small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it f lowers and bears fruit, 
and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the 
seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to 
fructify. There are different stages. The sinful ac tion may have already stopped within the 
individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still to be enjoyed. There are 
sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified 
and are giving us fruit , which we are enjoying as distress and pain.  
As explained in the twenty -eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter, a person who has 
completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious 
activities, being freed from the dualit y of this material world, becomes engaged in 
devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed 
from all reactions. This statement is confirmed in the  Padma Purāṇa:  
aprārabdha -phalaṁ pāpaṁ  
kūṭaṁ bījaṁ phalonmukham  
krameṇaiva pralīyeta  
viṣṇu -bhakti -ratātmanām  
For those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructif ied, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, 
gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and 
it is called  pavitram uttamam,  the purest.  Uttama  means transcendental.  Tamas  means this 
material world or darkness, an d uttama  means that which is transcendental to material 
activities. Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it 
appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar 
with devotional s ervice will know that they are not material activities. They are all 
spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature.  
It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the 
results directly. Thi s direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience 
that any person who is chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa (Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa 
Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare) in course of chanting 
without offenses feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of 
all material contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in 
hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he  
engages himself in helping the missionary activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he gradually 
feels spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of 
previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that by  simply engaging 
in it one becomes pure.  
In the  Vedānta -sūtra  (3.2.26) this is also described in the following words:  prakāśaś ca 
karmaṇy abhyāsāt.  “Devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the 
activities of devotional service one becomes  enlightened without a doubt.” A practical 
example of this can be seen in the previous life of Nārada, who in that life happened to be 
the son of a maidservant. He had no education, nor was he born into a high family. But 
when his mother was engaged in ser ving great devotees, Nārada also became engaged, and 
sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. Nārada personally says,  
ucchiṣṭa -lepān anumodito dvijaiḥ  
sakṛt sma bhuñje tad -apāsta- kilbiṣaḥ  
evaṁ pravṛttasya viśuddha -cetasas  
tad-dharma evātma- ruciḥ prajāyate  
In this verse from  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  (1.5.25)  Nārada describes his previous life to his 
disciple Vyāsadeva. He says that while engaged as a boy servant for  those purified 
devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately associating with them. 
Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would 
wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the gre at devotees for their 
permission, and when they gave it Nārada ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on eating, he gradually became as pure -hearted 
as the sages. The great devotees relished the taste of unce asing devotional service to the 
Lord by hearing and chanting, and Nārada gradually developed the same taste. Nārada 
says further,  
tatrānv -ahaṁ kṛṣṇa- kathāḥ pragāyatām  
anugraheṇāśṛṇavaṁ mano- harāḥ 
tāḥ śraddhayā me ’nu- padaṁ viśṛṇvataḥ 
priyaśravasy aṅga mamābhavad ruciḥ  
By associating with the sages, Nārada got the taste for hearing and chanting the glories of 
the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service. Therefore, as described in 
the Vedānta -sūtra, prakāśaś ca karmaṇy abhyāsāt:  if one is  engaged simply in the acts of 
devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. 
This is called  pratyakṣa,  directly perceived.  
The word dharmyam means “the path of religion.” Nārada was actually a son of a 
maidservant.  He had no opportunity to go to school. He was simply assisting his mother, 
and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees. The child Nārada also 
got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religion. 
The highest goal of all religion is devotional service, as stated in  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  (sa 
vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje ). Religious people generally do not 
know that the highest perfection of  religion is the attainment of devotional service. As we 
have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight ( vedeṣu yajñeṣu 
tapaḥsu caiva ), generally Vedic knowledge is required for self -realization. But here, 
although Nārada never went to  the school of the spiritual master and was not educated in 
the Vedic principles, he acquired the highest results of Vedic study. This process is so 
potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to 
the highest perfe ction. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic 
literature:  ācāryavān puruṣo veda.  One who is in association with great  ācāryas,  even if 
he is not educated or has never studied the  Vedas,  can become familiar with all the 
knowledge necessary for realization.  
The process of devotional service is a very happy one ( su-sukham ). Why? Devotional 
service consists of  śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ,  so one can simply hear the chanting of the 
glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given 
by authorized ācāryas.  Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of 
the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. 
One can execute devotional service even in the most  poverty -stricken condition. The Lord 
says,  patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam:  He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of 
offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the wor ld, can be offered by any person, regardless of social 
position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply by tasting the  tulasī  leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like 
Sanat -kumāra became  great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it 
can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.  
It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as the Māy āvādī 
philosophers claim. Although they sometimes take to so -called devotional service, their 
idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will continue their devotional service, but 
at the end, when they become liberated, they will “become one with God.” Such 
temporary time -serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service. 
Actual devotional service continues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in se rving the Supreme 
Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.  
As will be seen in Bhagavad -gītā, actual devotional service begins after liberation. After 
one is liberated, when one is situate d in the Brahman position ( brahma -bhūta), one’s 
devotional service begins ( samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad -bhaktiṁ labhate parām). No one 
can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma -yoga, jñāna -
yoga, aṣṭāṅga -yoga  or any other  yoga  indepe ndently. By these yogic methods one may 
make a little progress toward  bhakti- yoga,  but without coming to the stage of devotional 
service one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the  Śrīm ad-
Bhāgavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process 
of devotional service, especially by hearing  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  or Bhagavad -gītā from 
realized souls, then he can understand the science of Kṛṣṇa, or the science of God.  Evaṁ 
prasanna- manaso bhagavad- bhakti- yogataḥ.  When one’s heart is cleared of all nonsense, 
then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is 
the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore 
one should adopt it.

By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in

Purport  
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. It is said,  
ataḥ śrī -kṛṣṇa -nāmādi  
na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ  
sevonmukhe hi jihvādau  
svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ  
(Bhakti -rasāmṛta -sindhu  1.2.234)  
Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood b y material senses. 
Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the  Brahma -saṁhitā  (5.38) it is stated,  premāñjana -cchurita -bhakti-
vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti:  one can see the Supreme Per sonality of 
Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. 
Here it is said that although He is all -pervading, everywhere present , He is not 
conceivable by the material senses. This is indicated here by the word  avyakta -
mūrtinā.  But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we 
have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a 
combination of His two different energies – the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, 
material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is restin g in that energy.  
Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal 
existence. To refute such an argument the Lord says, “I am everywhere, and everything is 
in Me, but still I am aloof.” For example, a king heads a government which is but the 
manifestation of the king’s energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but 
the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king’s power. But still one 
cannot expect the king to be present in every de partment personally. That is a crude 
example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see and everything that exists, both in 
this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. The creation ta kes place by the diffusion of His different 
energies, and, as stated in the  Bhagavad -gītā, viṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam:  He is 
everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different  energies.

This material nature, which is one of My energies, is working under My direction, O

Purport  
It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the activities of the 
material world, remains the supreme director. The Supreme Lord is the s upreme will and 
the background of this material manifestation, but the management is being conducted by 
material nature. Kṛṣṇa also states in  Bhagavad -gītā that of all the living entities in 
different form s and species, “I am the father.” The father gives seeds to the womb of the 
mother for the child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the 
living entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different forms  
and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these living entities, although 
born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, take their different bodies according to their 
past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this  material creation. He 
simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is 
created immediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly 
activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation 
of the material world directly. This example is given in the  smṛti:  when there is a fragrant 
flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet 
the smelling and the flower are detached from one another. There is a similar connection 
between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has 
nothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In 
summary, material nature, without the super intendence of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material 
activities.

Translation 
Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My

Purport  
From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a 
common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and 
annihilation of the  complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are 
many foolish men who consider Kṛṣṇa to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the  Brahma -
saṁhitā (īśvaraḥ parama ḥ kṛṣṇaḥ ); He is the Supreme Lord.  
There are many  īśvaras,  controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary 
management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above 
him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of 
them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the  Brahma -saṁhitā  it is said that 
Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly, both in the 
material and spiritual world, but Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller ( īśvaraḥ paramaḥ 
kṛṣṇaḥ ), and His body is  sac-cid-ānanda,  nonmaterial.  
Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body 
is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is n ot a common man, the foolish 
deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here  mānuṣīm  because He is 
acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna’s, a politician involved in the Battle of 
Kurukṣetra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body 
is sac-cid-ānanda -vigraha – eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed in the 
Vedic language also.  Sac-cid-ānanda -rūpāya kṛṣṇāya:  “I offer my obeisances unto the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge.” 
(Gopāla- tāpanī Upaniṣad  1.1) There are other descriptions in the Vedic language 
also. Tam ekaṁ govindam:  “You are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the 
cows.”  Sac-cid-ānanda -vigraham:  “And Your form is transce ndental, full of knowledge, 
bliss and eternality.” ( Gopāla -tāpanī Upaniṣad  1.38)  
Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s body, its full bliss and knowledge, 
there are many so -called scholars and commentators of  Bhagavad -gītā who deride Kṛṣṇa 
as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous 
good work, but this conception of Śrī Kṛṣṇa is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore 
he is called  mūḍha,  for only fo olish persons consider Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human 
being. The foolish consider Kṛṣṇa an ordinary human being because they do not know the 
confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know 
that Kṛṣṇa’s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor 
of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not 
know that Kṛṣṇa has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.  
Nor do they know that the appear ance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this 
material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master of the material 
energy. As has been explained in several places ( mama māyā duratyayā ), He claims that 
the material energy, althoug h very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders 
unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to Kṛṣṇa 
can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who 
conducts the creat ion, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a 
material body like us? So this conception of Kṛṣṇa is complete foolishness. Foolish 
persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, appearing just 
like an ordina ry man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic 
manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their 
conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can 
simultaneously control the i nfinite and the minute. Actually, although He is controlling the 
infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning 
His yogam aiśvaram,  His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the 
infinite  and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although 
the foolish cannot imagine how Kṛṣṇa, who appears just like a human being, can control 
the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto 
Him and engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.  
There are many controversies between the impersonalists and the personalists about the 
Lord’s appea rance as a human being. But if we consult  Bhagavad- gītā and Śrīmad -
Bhāgavatam,  the authoritative texts for understanding the science of Kṛṣṇa, then we can 
understand that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the  Śrīmad -
Bhāgavatam,  First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by Śaunaka inquired about 
the activities of Kṛṣṇa, they said:  
kṛtavān kila karmāṇi  
saha rāmeṇa keśavaḥ  
ati-martyāni bhagavān 
gūḍhaḥ kapaṭa- māṇuṣaḥ 
“Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with Balarāma, played like a 
huma n being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts.” ( Bhāg.  1.1.20) The 
Lord’s appearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that Kṛṣṇa performed while He  was present on this earth. When Kṛṣṇa 
appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devakī, He appeared with four 
hands, but after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. 
As stated in the  Bhāgavatam  (10.3.46),  babhūva prākṛtaḥ śiśuḥ:  He became just like an 
ordinary child, an ordinary human being. Now, here again it is indicated that the Lord’s 
appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transc endental body. 
In the Eleventh Chapter of  Bhagavad -gītā also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see 
Kṛṣṇa’s form of four hands ( tenaiva rūpeṇa catur -bhujena ). After revealing this form, 
Kṛṣṇa, when petitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form ( mānuṣaṁ 
rūpam ). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an 
ordinary human being.  
Some of those who deride Kṛṣṇa and who are infected with the Māyāvādī philosophy quote the following verse from the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam (3.29.21)  to prove that Kṛṣṇa is 
just an ordinary man.  Ahaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu bhūtātmāvasthitaḥ sadā:  “The Supreme is 
present in every living entity.”  We should better take note of this particular verse from the 
Vaiṣṇava  ācāryas  like Jīva Gosvāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura instead of 
following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride Kṛṣṇa. Jīva Gosvāmī, 
commenting on this verse, says that Kṛṣṇa, in His plenary expansion as Paramātmā, is 
situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the  arcā-mūrti,  the form of the Supreme Lord in 
the temple, and does not r espect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of 
the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is 
in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple 
than to ot her devotees, so Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura warns that this sort of mentality 
should be corrected. A devotee should see that because Kṛṣṇa is present in everyone’s 
heart as Paramātmā, every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so 
as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each 
and every body in which the Paramātmā dwells. Everyone should therefore be given 
proper respect and should not be neglected.  
There are also many impersonalists who der ide temple worship. They say that since God 
is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the 
impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness knows that although Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality, He is all -pervading, 
as confirmed in the  Brahma -saṁhitā.  Although His personal abode is Goloka Vṛndāvana 
and He is always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His 
plenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual 
creation.

Translation 
Those who are thus be wildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that 
deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their 
culture of knowledge are all defeated.  
Purport  
There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in Kṛṣṇa c onsciousness and 
devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, 
as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit of devotional service – going back to Godhead – 
will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are engaged in f ruitive pious activities and who 
are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. In 
other words, persons who mock Kṛṣṇa are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As 
described in the Seventh Chapter of  Bhagavad -gītā, such demonic miscreants never 
surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth 
bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and Kṛṣṇa are one and the 
same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now 
simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material 
body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one with 
Kṛṣṇa will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of 
spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this vers e. For such persons, 
cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the  Vedānta- sūtra  and 
the Upaniṣads,  is always baffled.  
It is a great offense, therefore, to consider Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to 
be an ordinary man. Those wh o do so are certainly deluded because they cannot 
understand the eternal form of Kṛṣṇa. The  Bṛhad -viṣṇu -smṛti  clearly states:  
yo vetti bhautikaṁ dehaṁ  
kṛṣṇasya paramātmanaḥ  
sa sarvasmād bahiṣ -kāryaḥ  
śrauta -smārta -vidhānataḥ 
mukhaṁ tasyāvalokyāpi

“One who considers the body of Kṛṣṇa to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the  śruti and the  smṛti.  And if one by chance sees his face, one should at 
once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself of infection.” P eople jeer at Kṛṣṇa because 
they are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take 
birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real 
knowledge will remain under delusion, and gradua lly they will regress to the darkest 
region of creation.

Translation 
O son of Pṛthā, those wh o are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection 
of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know 
Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.  
Purport  
In this verse the description of  the mahātmā  is clearly given. The first sign of 
the mahātmā  is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the control 
of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one 
who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the qualification. One can become free 
from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme 
Personality of Godhe ad. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon 
as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the 
guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daivī 
prakṛti,  divine nature. So when one is promoted in that way – by surrendering to the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead – one attains to the stage of great soul,  mahātmā.  
The mahātmā  does not divert his attention to anything outside Kṛṣṇa, because he knows 
perfectly well t hat Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. There is 
no doubt about it. Such a  mahātmā,  or great soul, develops through association with 
other  mahātmās,  pure devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by Kṛṣṇa’s other 
features, s uch as the four -armed Mahā -viṣṇu. They are simply attracted by the two- armed 
form of Kṛṣṇa. They are not attracted to other features of Kṛṣṇa, nor are they concerned 
with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They meditate only upon Kṛṣṇa in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness.

Translation 
Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down

Purport  
The mahātmā  cannot be manufactured by rubber -stamping an ordinary man. His 
symptoms are described here: a  mahātmā  is always engaged in chanting the glories of the 
Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead. He  has no other business. He is always 
engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not an impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His 
holy name, His eternal form, His trans cendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. 
One has to glorify all these things; therefore a  mahātmā is attached to the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead.  
One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the  brahma -jyotir,  is 
not describe d as mahātmā  in the  Bhagavad -gītā. He is described in a different way in the 
next verse. The  mahātmā  is always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as 
described in the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam , hearing and chanting about Viṣṇu, not a demigod or 
human being. That is devotion:  śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ  and smaraṇam,  remembering 
Him. Such a  mahātmā has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate en d the 
association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five transcendental  rasas.  To achieve 
that success, he engages all activities – mental, bodily and vocal, everything – in the 
service of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. That is called full Kṛṣṇa consciou sness.  
In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ekādaśī, and on the appearance day of the Lord. All these rules and regulations are offered by the gr eat ācāryas  for those 
who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world. The  mahātmās,  great souls, strictly 
observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they a re sure to achieve the desired 
result.  
As described in the second verse of this chapter, not only is this devotional service easy, 
but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo any severe 
penance and austerity. He can live this life  in devotional service, guided by an expert 
spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a  sannyāsī or 
a brahmacārī;  in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional 
service to the Supreme Personality of Godhea d and thus become actually mahātmā,  a 
great soul.

Purport  
One who is unable to live for a moment without Kṛṣṇa conscious ness cannot but think of 
Kṛṣṇa twenty- four hours a day, being engaged in devotional service by hearing, chanting, 
remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating friendship and surrenderi ng fully to the Lord. Such activities are 
all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies, which make the devotee perfect in self -
realization, so that his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality 
of Godhead. Such a devotee undoubtedly approaches the Lord without difficulty. This is 
called  yoga.  By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material 
condition of life.  Kṣema  refers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the 
devotee to achieve Kṛṣṇa consciousness by yoga,  and when he becomes fully Kṛṣṇa 
conscious the Lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life.

Purport  
If one has any desire to go to the moon, the sun or any other planet, one can attain the 
desired destination by following specific Vedic principles recommended for that purpose, 
such as the process technically known as Darśa -paurṇamāsa. These are vividly described 
in the fruitive activities portion of the  Vedas, which recommends a specific worship of 
demigods situated on different heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the Pitā planets by performing a specific  yajña.  Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become 
a Yakṣa, Rakṣa or Piśāca. Piśāca  worship is called “black arts” or “black magic.” There 
are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the 
Supreme Personality of G odhead only, achieves the planets of Vaikuṇṭha and Kṛṣṇaloka 
without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by 
simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping 
the Pitās achieve the Pitā planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly 
planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu? Unfortunately 
many people have no information of these sublime planets where Kṛṣṇa and Viṣṇu live, 
and because the y do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down 
from the  brahma -jyotir.  The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore distributing 
sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa  mantra one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to 
Godhead.

Purport  
For the intelligent person, it is essential to be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaged in the 
transcendental loving service of the Lord, in order to achieve a permanent, blissful abode 
for eternal happiness. The process of achieving such a marvel ous result is very easy and 
can be attempted even by the poorest of the poor, without any kind of qualification. The only qualification required in this connection is to be a pure devotee of the Lord. It does 
not matter what one is or where one is situated. The process is so easy that even a leaf or a 
little water or fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will 
be pleased to accept it. No one, therefore, can be barred from Kṛṣṇa consciousness, 
because it is so easy and universa l. Who is such a fool that he does not want to be Kṛṣṇa 
conscious by this simple method and thus attain the highest perfectional life of eternity, 
bliss and knowledge? Kṛṣṇa wants only loving service and nothing more. Kṛṣṇa accepts 
even a little flower fro m His pure devotee. He does not want any kind of offering from a 
nondevotee. He is not in need of anything from anyone, because He is self -sufficient, and 
yet He accepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of love and affection. To develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest perfection of life.  Bhakti is mentioned twice in 
this verse in order to declare more emphatically that  bhakti,  or devotional service, is the 
only means to approach Kṛṣṇa. No other condition, such as becoming a  brāhmaṇa,  a 
learned scholar, a very rich man or a great philosopher, can induce Kṛṣṇa to accept some 
offering. Without the basic principle of  bhakti,  nothing can induce the Lord to agree to 
accept anything from anyone.  Bhakti is never causal. The process is eternal. It is dir ect 
action in service to the absolute whole.  
Here Lord Kṛṣṇa, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be 
offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be 
purified and to reach the goal of life – the transcendental loving service of God – then one 
should find out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves Kṛṣṇa will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. 
Thus meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Kṛṣṇa. If He desired such things as 
offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and 
water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, “I will accept it.” Therefore, we 
should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, 
milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord Kṛṣṇa 
Himself. W hatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus 
we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.  
In the Third Chapter, verse 13, Śrī Kṛṣṇa explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified a nd fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release 
from the clutches of the material entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are eating only sin. In other words, their every 
mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. 
But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of 
Lord Kṛṣṇa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering 
enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues 
which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude 
of love. Kṛṣṇa has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He 
will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important 
element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for Kṛṣṇa.  
The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without 
senses, cannot comprehend this verse of  Bhagavad -gītā. To them, it is either a metaphor 
or proof of the mundane character of Kṛṣṇa, the speaker of the  Bhagavad -gītā. But, in 
actuality, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is 
what it means to say that Kṛṣṇa is absolu te. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered 
full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, Kṛṣṇa has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And 
so in this instance, Kṛ ṣṇa’s hearing the devotee’s words of love in offering foodstuffs 
is wholly  identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be emphasized: 
because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts Kṛṣṇa as He describes Himself, without 
interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.

Whatever you do, whateve r you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever

Purport  
Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget Kṛṣṇa 
in any circumstance. Eve ryone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, 
and Kṛṣṇa recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat 
something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa. 
Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore Kṛṣṇa 
recommends, “Do it for Me,” and this is called  arcana.  Everyone has a tendency to give 
something in charity; Kṛṣṇa says, “Give it to Me,” and this means that all surplus money 
accumulated sh ould be utilized in furthering the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. 
Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not 
practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on Kṛṣṇa twenty -four hours a day 
by chanting the Har e Kṛṣṇa  mantra round his beads, he is surely the greatest meditator and 
the greatest  yogī,  as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of  Bhagavad -gītā.

Translation 
I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders 
service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.  
Purport  
One may question here that if Kṛṣṇa is equal to everyone and no one is His special friend, 
then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in His 
transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this 
material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own 
children. The Lord claims that every living entity – in whatever form – is His son, and so 
He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a 
cloud which pours rain all over, regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water. But 
for His devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are 
always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in 
Kṛṣṇa. The very phrase “Kṛṣ ṇa consciousness” suggests that those who are in such 
consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here 
distinctly,  mayi te:  “They are in Me.” Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This 
is reciprocal. This also ex plains the words  ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva 
bhajāmy aham:  “Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him.” This 
transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious. 
When a diamond is set in a  golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the 
same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord he looks like gold. The L ord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure 
state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a 
reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is n o 
personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the 
Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is.  
The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants 
from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more complete. The 
Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the manifestation of the Lord’s 
special mercy to the devotees. The Lord’s reciprocation should not be conside red to be 
under the law of  karma.  It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and 
His devotees function. Devotional service to the Lord is not an activity of this material 
world; it is part of the spiritual world, where eternity, bliss and  knowledge predominate.

Translation 
Even if one c ommits the most abominable action, if he is engaged in devotional 
service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated in his 
determination.  
Purport  
The word su-durācāraḥ used in this verse is very significant, and we should understand it  
properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is 
conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the 
rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for  the devotees, in 
connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides 
these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in 
Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called 
transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional 
service and the conditional service in r elation to the body will parallel one another. But 
then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his 
wholesome condition. He knows tha t perfection in his activities depends on his 
progressive realization of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a 
person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable 
socially or politically. But such a  temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In 
the Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  it is stated that if a person falls down but is wholeheartedly 
engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, bei ng situated within 
his heart, purifies him and excuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a  yogī fully engaged in the service of the Lord 
sometimes becomes ensnared; but Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so strong that such a n 
occasional falldown is at once rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is 
always a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the 
ideal path, for, as explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns wil l be stopped in 
due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  
Therefore a person who is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is engaged with 
determination in the process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare  
Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare should be considered to be in the 
transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen. The 
words  sādhur eva,  “he is saintly,” are very emphatic. They are a warning to the 
nonde votees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he 
should still be considered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down. And the 
word  mantavyaḥ  is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a 
devotee for his accidental falldown, then one is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. 
The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.  
In the  Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa  the following statement is given:  
bhagav ati ca harāv ananya -cetā 
bhṛśa -malino ’pi virājate manuṣyaḥ  
na hi śaśa- kaluṣa -cchabiḥ kadācit  
timira -parābhavatām upaiti candraḥ  
The meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable ac tivities, these activities should be considered 
to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on the moon. Such spots do not 
become an impediment to the diffusion of moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of 
a devotee from the path of sain tly character does not make him abominable.  
On the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental 
devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of materi al connections. Devotional service is more or 
less a declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he is no longer subject ed to such falldowns, as previously explained. No one 
should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a 
devotee. If he does not improve in his character by devotional service, then it is to be 
understood that he is not a high devotee.

Translation 
O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower  birth – women, 
vaiśyas [merchants] and śūdras [workers] – can attain the supreme destination.  
Purport  
It is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there is no 
distinction between the lower and higher classes of people. In the  material conception of 
life there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in transcendental devotional service to the Lord there are not. Everyone is eligible for the supreme destination. In the  Śrīmad -
Bhāgavatam (2.4.18)  it is stated that even the lowest, who are called  caṇḍālas  (dog-
eaters), can be purified by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service 
and the guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discri mination between 
the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking 
shelter of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the different 
modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of g oodness ( brāhmaṇas ), the 
mode of passion ( kṣatriyas,  or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance 
(vaiśyas,  or merchants), and the mode of ignorance ( śūdras,  or workers). Those lower than 
them are called  caṇḍālas,  and they are born in sinful families. Generally, the association 
of those born in sinful families is not accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service is so strong that the pure devotee of the Supreme Lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain  the highest perfection of life. This is possible only 
when one takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa. As indicated here by the word vyapāśritya,  one has to 
take shelter completely of Kṛṣṇa. Then one can become much greater than great  jñānīs  and yogīs.

Purport  
In this verse it is clearly indicated that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only means of being 
delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous 
commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service 
shoul d be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Unfortunately, 
unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa’s 
mind and Kṛṣṇa . Kṛṣṇa is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, 
His mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in the  Kūrma Purāṇa,  as it is 
quoted by Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī in his  Anubhāṣya comments on  Caitanya -
caritāmṛta  (Fifth Chapter,  Ādi-līlā, verses 41 –48), deha -dehi-vibhedo ’yaṁ neśvare 
vidyate kvacit.  This means that there is no difference in Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, between 
Himself and His body. But because the commentators do not know this science of Kṛṣṇa, they hide  Kṛṣṇa and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although 
this is sheer ignorance of the science of Kṛṣṇa, some men make profit out of misleading 
people.  
There are some who are demonic; they also think of Kṛṣṇa, but enviously, just like Ki ng 
Kaṁsa, Kṛṣṇa’s uncle. He was also thinking of Kṛṣṇa always, but he thought of Kṛṣṇa as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when Kṛṣṇa would come to kill him. 
That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of Kṛṣṇa in devotiona l love. 
That is  bhakti.  One should cultivate the knowledge of Kṛṣṇa continuously. What is that 
favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is  not 
material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about Kṛṣṇa will help one 
become a devotee. Understanding Kṛṣṇa otherwise, from the wrong source, will prove 
fruitless.  
One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the prima l form of Kṛṣṇa; with 
conviction in his heart that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. 
There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of Kṛṣṇa, and 
devotional service is practiced there. When such practice is mad e, one has to offer 
obeisances to Kṛṣṇa. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his 
body, his activities –  everything. That will make one fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa without 
deviation. This will help one transfer to Kṛṣṇaloka. One shou ld not be deviated by 
unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of 
devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about Kṛṣṇa. Pure devotional 
service is the highest achievement of human society.  
The Seventh and Ei ghth chapters of  Bhagavad -gītā have explained pure devotional service 
to the Lord that is free from speculative knowledge, mystic  yoga  and fruitive activities. 
Those who are not purely sanctified may be at tracted by different features of the Lord like 
the impersonal  brahma- jyotir  and localized Paramātmā, but a pure devotee directly takes 
to the service of the Supreme Lord.  
There is a beautiful poem about Kṛṣṇa in which it is clearly stated that any person w ho is 
engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of Kṛṣṇa. The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the 
standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers 
and yogīs.  One who always engages in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be understood to be a 
perfectly saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will 
soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devot ee has no actual 
chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to the process of Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness and happily live in this material world. He will eventually receive the 
supreme award of Kṛṣṇa.  
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of the  Śrīmad Bhagavad -gītā in 
the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge.

Purport  
A learned scholar who has studied the  Vedas  perfectly and has information from 
authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachin gs can 
understand that Kṛṣṇa is the origin of everything in both the material and spiritual worlds, 
and because he knows this perfectly he becomes firmly fixed in the devotional service of 
the Supreme Lord. He can never be deviated by any amount of nonsens ical commentaries 
or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that Kṛṣṇa is the source of Brahmā, Śiva and all 
other demigods. In the  Atharva Veda  (Gopāla -tāpanī Upaniṣad  1.24) it is said,  yo 
brahmāṇaṁ vidadhāti pūrvaṁ yo vai vedāṁś ca gāpayati sma kṛṣṇaḥ:  “It was Kṛṣṇa who 
in the beginning instructed Brahmā in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic 
knowledge in the past.” Then again the  Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad (1) says,  atha puruṣo ha vai 
nārāyaṇo ’kāmayata prajāḥ sṛjeyeti:  “Then the Supreme Personality Nārāyaṇ a desired to 
create living entities.” The  Upaniṣad  continues,  nārāyaṇād brahmā jāyate, nārāyaṇād 
prajāpatiḥ prajāyate, nārāyaṇād indro jāyate, nārāyaṇād aṣṭau vasavo jāyante, 
nārāyaṇād ekādaśa rudrā jāyante, nārāyaṇād dvādaśādityāḥ:  “From Nārāyaṇa, Brahmā is 
born, and from Nārāyaṇa the patriarchs are also born. From Nārāyaṇa, Indra is born, from 
Nārāyaṇa the eight Vasus are born, from Nārāyaṇa the eleven Rudras are born, from Nārāyaṇa the twelve Ādityas are born.” This Nārāyaṇa is an expansion of Kṛṣṇa.  
It is said in the same  Vedas, brahmaṇyo devakī -putraḥ:  “The son of Devakī, Kṛṣṇa, is the 
Supreme Personality.” ( Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad  4) Then it is said,  eko vai nārāyaṇa āsīn na 
brahmā neśāno nāpo nāgni- somau neme dyāv -āpṛthivī na nakṣatrāṇi na sūryaḥ:  “In the 
beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality Nārāyaṇa. There was no 
Brahmā, no Śiva, no water, no fire, no moon, no heaven and earth, no stars in the sky, no 
sun.” ( Mahā Upaniṣad 1.2) In the  Mahā Upaniṣad it is also said that Lord Śiva w as born 
from the forehead of the Supreme Lord. Thus the  Vedas  say that it is the Supreme Lord, 
the creator of Brahmā and Śiva, who is to be worshiped.  
In the  Mokṣa -dharma  section of the  Mahābhārata,  Kṛṣṇa also says,  
prajāpatiṁ ca rudraṁ cāpy  
aham eva sṛjāmi vai  
tau hi māṁ na vijānīto  
mama māyā -vimohitau  
“The patriarchs, Śiva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are 
created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy.” In the  Varāha Purāṇa  it 
is also said,  
nārāyaṇaḥ paro d evas 
tasmāj jātaś caturmukhaḥ  
tasmād rudro ’bhavad devaḥ  
sa ca sarva -jñatāṁ gataḥ  
“Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahmā was born, from 
whom Śiva was born.”  
Lord Kṛṣṇa is the source of all generations, and He is called the mos t efficient cause of 
everything. He says, “Because everything is born of Me, I am the original source of all. 
Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.” There is no supreme controller other than 
Kṛṣṇa. One who understands Kṛṣṇa in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master, with 
references from Vedic literature, engages all his energy in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and 
becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not know Kṛṣṇa 
properly, are but fools. Only a fool would consider Kṛṣṇa t o be an ordinary man. A Kṛṣṇa 
conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized 
commentaries and interpretations on  Bhagavad -gītā and proceed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness 
with determination and firmness.

Translation 
The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are fully devoted to My 
service, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss from always enlightening one 
another and conversing about Me.  
Purport  
Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully in the 
transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds ca nnot be diverted from the lotus 
feet of Kṛṣṇa. Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the 
pure devotees are described in this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are 
twenty- four hours daily engaged in glorifying  the qualities and pastimes of the Supreme 
Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in Kṛṣṇa, and they take pleasure in 
discussing Him with other devotees.  
In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from 
the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once 
situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is 
exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendent al devotional 
service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable 
living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them 
there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devot ee and get the chance to 
understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown 
in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare 
Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare R āma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, that 
seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant 
of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the 
material universe and enters into the  brahma- jyotir  effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the 
spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which 
is called Goloka Vṛndāvana, the supreme planet of Kṛṣṇa. Ultimately, the plant takes 
shelter under the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and 
flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in 
the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully 
described in the  Caitanya -caritāmṛta  (Madhya -līlā, Chapter Nineteen). It is explained 
there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, 
one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment 
without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. 
In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the 
Supreme Lord.  
The Śrīmad -Bhāg avatam is also full of such narrations about the relationship between the 
Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  is very dear to the 
devotees, as stated in the  Bhāgavatam  itself (12.13.18).  Śrīmad -bhāgavataṁ purāṇam 
amalaṁ yad vaiṣṇavānāṁ priyam.  In this narration there is nothing about material 
activities, economic development, sense gratification or liberation.  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  is 
the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His 
devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in Kṛṣṇa consciousness take continual 
pleasure in hearing such trans cendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take 
pleasure in association.

Translation 
To those who are constantly devoted to serving Me with love, I give the 
understanding by which they can come to Me.  
Purport  
In this verse the word buddhi -yogam  is very significant. We m ay remember that in the 
Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many 
things and that He would instruct him in the way of  buddhi -yoga.  Now  buddhi- yoga  is 
explained.  Buddhi- yoga  itself is action in Kṛṣṇa consciousness; that is the highest 
intelligence.  Buddhi means intelligence, and  yoga  means mystic activities or mystic 
elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness in devotional service, his action is called  buddhi -yoga. In other 
words,  buddhi -yoga  is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this 
material world. The ultimate goal of progress is Kṛṣṇa. People do not know this; therefore 
the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are imp ortant. One should 
know that the goal is Kṛṣṇa, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.  
When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is a cting 
in karma -yoga.  When he knows that the goal is Kṛṣṇa but he takes pleasure in mental 
speculations to understand Kṛṣṇa, he is acting in jñāna -yoga.  And when he knows the goal 
and seeks Kṛṣṇa completely in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service, he is acting 
in bhakti- yoga,  or buddhi -yoga,  which is the complete  yoga.  This complete  yoga  is the 
highest perfectional stage of life.  
A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but if he is still not intel ligent enough to make progress, then Kṛṣṇa from 
within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty. 
The qualification is that a person always engage himself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and with 
love and devotion render all ki nds of services. He should perform some sort of work for 
Kṛṣṇa, and that work should be with love. If a devotee is not intelligent enough to make 
progress on the path of self -realization but is sincere and devoted to the activities of 
devotional service, t he Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to 
Him.

Translation 
To show them special mercy, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the sh ining 
lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.  
Purport  
When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare 
Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, 
thousands of people were following Hi m. Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, a very influential and 
learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. 
Sometimes Māyāvādī philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of 
the devotees are in the dark ness of ignorance and are philosophically naive 
sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion. But even if a devotee does not take 
advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional 
service he is helped by Kṛṣṇa Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in 
Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one 
carry out devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.  
The Māyāvādī philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure 
knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in 
pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, 
as stated in this verse.  
The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Tr uth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, 
for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve 
Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go on speculating for several millions of 
years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never 
understand Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, Kṛṣṇa, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the 
pure devotee. The pure devotee always has Kṛṣṇa within his heart; and with the presence 
of Kṛṣṇa, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignorance is at once dissipated. This is 
the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by Kṛṣṇa.  
Due to the contamin ation of material association, through many, many millions of births, 
one’s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in 
devotional service and constantly chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, the dust quickly clears, and one is 
elevated to t he platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal, Viṣṇu, can be attained only 
by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The 
pure devotee does not have to worry about the material necessities of life; he need not be  
anxious, because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, who is pleased by the loving devotional service of the 
devotee. This is the essence of the teachings of  Bhagavad -gītā. By studying  Bhagavad -
gītā, one can become a soul completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord and engage 
himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors.

Purport  
In these  two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the Māyāvādī philosopher, for 
here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul. Arjuna, after hearing 
the essential four verses of  Bhagavad- gītā in this chapter, became completely free from all 
doubts and accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly 
declares, “You are  paraṁ brahma,  the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” And previously 
Kṛṣṇa stated that He is the o riginator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and 
every human being is dependent on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that 
they are absolute and independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That ignorance 
is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This has already been 
explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now, by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him 
as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not that because 
Kṛṣṇa is Arjuna’s intima te friend Arjuna is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is 
confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional 
service to the Su preme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every 
word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.  
In the  Kena Upaniṣad  it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and 
Kṛṣṇa has already explaine d that everything is resting on Him. The  Muṇḍaka 
Upaniṣad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized 
only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of Kṛṣṇa is smaraṇam,  one of the methods  of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to 
Kṛṣṇa that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.  
In the  Vedas  the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who understands 
that Kṛṣṇa is the purest of t he pure can become purified from all sinful activities. One 
cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna’s acceptance of Kṛṣṇa as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic 
literature. This is  also confirmed by great personalities, of whom Nārada is the chief.  
Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him 
and enjoy one’s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme existence. He is 
free from bod ily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the 
Vedic literatures, the  Purāṇas  and histories. In all Vedic literatures Kṛṣṇa is thus 
described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, “Although I am 
unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.” He is the supreme origin; 
He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. 
This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.  
Here Arjuna e xpresses himself through the grace of Kṛṣṇa. If we want to 
understand Bhagavad -gītā, we should accept the statements in these two verses. This is 
called the  paramparā system, acceptance of the disciplic su ccession. Unless one is in the 
disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad -gītā. It is not possible by so -called 
academic education. Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite s o 
much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary person.

Translation 
My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, 
standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter 
into the mysteries of My understanding.  
 
 
Purport 
Kṛṣṇa can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He 
explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators, who try to 
understand Bhagavad -gītā by the spe culative process, will know that they are simply 
wasting their time. No one can understand Kṛṣṇa or how He came from parents in a four -
handed form and at once changed Himself into a two- handed form. These things are very 
difficult to understand by study of  the Vedas  or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it 
is clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about 
Him from the Vedic l iterature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, 
and if one at all wants to understand Kṛṣṇa, he must follow the regulative principles 
described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with 
those principles . For example, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on 
Janmāṣṭamī, the day on which Kṛṣṇa appeared, and on the two days of Ekādaśī (the 
eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon). As far as 
charity is concerned , it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of Kṛṣṇa who 
are engaged in His devotional service to spread the Kṛṣṇa philosophy, or Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, throughout the world. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a benediction to humanity. 
Lord Caitanya was appreciated by Rūpa Gosvāmī as the most munificent man of charity 
because love of Kṛṣṇa, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. 
So if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributing Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, th at charity, given to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the greatest charity in 
the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is 
always some statue, usually of Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa), that is a chance to progress by offerin g 
worship and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the beginners in 
devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the 
Vedic literature ( Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.23):  
yasya deve parā bhaktir  
yathā deve ta thā gurau  
tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ  
prakāśante mahātmanaḥ  
One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual 
master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead by revelation. One cannot understand Kṛṣṇa by mental speculation. For one who 
does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is 
impossible to even begin to understand Kṛṣṇa. The word tu is specifically used here to 
indicate that no o ther process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in 
understanding Kṛṣṇa.  
The personal forms of Kṛṣṇa, the two -handed form and the four -handed, are described 
as su-durdarśam , very difficult to see. They are completely different from the te mporary 
universal form shown to Arjuna. The four -handed form of Nārāyaṇa and the two -handed 
form of Kṛṣṇa are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to 
Arjuna is temporary. The words  tvad anyena na dṛṣṭa- pūrvam  (verse 47) state th at before 
Arjuna, no one had seen that universal form. Also, they suggest that amongst the devotees 
there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by Kṛṣṇa at the request of 
Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents himself as an inc arnation of God, people 
can ask to see his universal form.  
The word na, used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one should not be very 
much proud of such credentials as an academic education in Vedic literature. One must 
take to the devotiona l service of Kṛṣṇa. Only then can one attempt to write commentaries 
on Bhagavad- gītā. 
Kṛṣṇa changes from the universal form to the four -handed form of Nārāyaṇa and then to 
His own natural form of two hands . This indicates that the four -handed forms and other 
forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two -handed Kṛṣṇa. 
He is the origin of all emanations. Kṛṣṇa is distinct even from these forms, what to speak 
of the impersonal conc eption. As far as the four -handed forms of Kṛṣṇa are concerned, it 
is stated clearly that even the most identical four -handed form of Kṛṣṇa (which is known 
as Mahā -viṣṇu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many 
innumerable univers es are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme 
Lord. As stated in the  Brahma- saṁhitā (5.48),  
yasyaika -niśvasita -kālam athāvalambya  
jīvanti loma -vila-jā jagad- aṇḍa -nāthāḥ 
viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā- viśeṣo  
govindam ādi- puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi  
“The Mahā -viṣṇu, into whom all the innumerable universes enter and from whom they 
come forth again simply by His breathing process, is a plenary expansion of Kṛṣṇa. 
Therefore I worship Govinda, Kṛṣṇa, the cause of all causes.” Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
who has eternal bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Viṣṇu, He is the 
source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality,  as 
confirmed in  Bhagavad -gītā. 
In the Vedic literature ( Gopāla- tāpanī Upaniṣad  1.1) the following statement appears:  
sac-cid-ānanda- rūpāya  
kṛṣṇāyākliṣṭa -kāriṇe  
namo vedānta- vedyāya  
gurave buddhi- sākṣiṇe  
“I offer my respectful obeisances unto Kṛṣṇa, who has a transcendental form of bliss, 
eternity and knowledge. I offer my respect to Him, because understanding Him means 
understanding the  Vedas,  and He is therefore the supreme spiritual master.” Then it is 
said, kṛṣṇo vai paramaṁ daivatam:  “Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” 
(Gopāla- tāpanī Upaniṣad  1.3) Eko vaśī sarva- gaḥ kṛṣṇa īḍyaḥ:  “That one Kṛṣṇa is the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is worshipable.”  Eko ’pi san bahudhā yo 
’vabhāti:  “Kṛṣṇa is one, but He is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded 
incarnations.” ( Gopāla- tāpanī Upaniṣad  1.21)  
The Brahma- saṁhitā (5.1) says,  
īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ  
sac-cid-ānanda- vigrahaḥ 
anādir ādir govindaḥ  
sarva -kāraṇa -kāraṇam  
“The Supreme Personality o f Godhead is Kṛṣṇa, who has a body of eternity, knowledge 
and bliss. He has no beginning, for He is the beginning of everything. He is the cause of 
all causes.”  
Elsewhere it is said,  yatrāvatīrṇaṁ kṛṣṇākhyaṁ paraṁ brahma narākṛti:  “The Supreme 
Absolute Truth is a person, His name is Kṛṣṇa, and He sometimes descends on this earth.” Similarly, in the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam we find a description of all kinds of incarnations of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, an d in this list the name of Kṛṣṇa also appears. But 
then it is said that this Kṛṣṇa is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme 
Personality of Godhead Himself ( ete cāṁśa -kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam ). 
Similarly, in  Bhagavad -gītā the Lord says,  mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat:  “There is nothing 
superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa.” He also says elsewhere 
in Bhagavad- gītā, aham ādir hi devānām:  “I am the origin of all the demigods.” And after 
understanding Bhagavad- gītā from Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna also confirms this in the following 
words:  paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhav ān, “I now fully understand 
that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are 
the refuge of everything.” Therefore the universal form which Kṛṣṇa showed to Arjuna is 
not the original form of God. The original is the Kṛṣṇa form. The universal form, with its 
thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those 
who have no love for God. It is not God’s original form.  
The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in lov e with the Lord in 
different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental 
love in His original form of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related 
with Kṛṣṇa in friendship, this form of the universal manifestatio n was not pleasing; rather, 
it was fearful. Arjuna, who was a constant companion of Kṛṣṇa’s, must have had 
transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the 
universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who a re involved in elevating 
themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the 
two-handed form of Kṛṣṇa is the most dear.

Translation 
My dear Arjuna, he who engages in My pure devotional service, free from the 
contaminations of fruitive activities and mental speculation, he who works for Me, 
who makes Me the supreme goal of his life, and who is friendly to every living being 
– he certainly comes to Me.  
Purport  
Anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the 
Kṛṣṇaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme 
Personality, Kṛṣṇa, must take this formula, as stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, 
this verse is considered to be the essence of  Bhagavad -gītā. The Bhagavad -gītā is a book 
directed to the cond itioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose 
of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The  Bhagavad -
gītā is meant to show how one can understand hi s spiritual existence and his eternal 
relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home, 
back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one 
can attain success in his spiritual activ ity: devotional service.  
As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to Kṛṣṇa conscious activities. As stated in the  Bhakti- rasāmṛta -sindhu  (1.2.255),  
anāsaktasya viṣayān  
yathārham upayuñjataḥ  
nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa -sambandhe  
yuktaṁ vair āgyam ucyate  
No work should be done by any man except in relationship to Kṛṣṇa. This is called kṛṣṇa -
karma.  One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the 
result of his work; the result should be done only for Him. For exam ple, one may be 
engaged in business, but to transform that activity into Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one has to do 
business for Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of the business, then Kṛṣṇa should enjoy the 
profit of the business. If a businessman is in possessio n of thousands and thousands of 
dollars, and if he has to offer all this to Kṛṣṇa, he can do it. This is work for Kṛṣṇa. Instead 
of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for 
Kṛṣṇa, and he can install the De ity of Kṛṣṇa and arrange for the Deity’s service, as is 
outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all  kṛṣṇa -karma.  One 
should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to Kṛṣṇa, 
and one should accept as  prasādam the remnants of offerings to Kṛṣṇa. If one constructs a 
very big building for Kṛṣṇa and installs the Deity of Kṛṣṇa, one is not prohibited from 
living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is Kṛṣṇa. That is called 
Kṛṣṇ a consciousness. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for Kṛṣṇa, one can 
engage himself in cleansing the temple of Kṛṣṇa; that is also  kṛṣṇa -karma.  One can 
cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land – in India, at least, any poor man has a certa in 
amount of land – can utilize that for Kṛṣṇa by growing flowers to offer Him. One can 
sow tulasī  plants, because  tulasī  leaves are very important and Kṛṣṇa has recommended 
this in  Bhagavad -gītā. Patraṁ p uṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam.  Kṛṣṇa desires that one offer Him 
either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water – and by such an offering He is satisfied. 
This leaf especially refers to the  tulasī.  So one can sow tulasī  and pour water on the plant. 
Thus, even  the poorest man can engage in the service of Kṛṣṇa. These are some of the 
examples of how one can engage in working for Kṛṣṇa.  
The word mat-paramaḥ  refers to one who considers the association of Kṛṣṇa in His 
supreme abode to be the highest perfection of l ife. Such a person does not wish to be 
elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the 
highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only 
attracted to being transferred to the spir itual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not 
satisfied with merging into the glowing  brahma -jyotir  effulgence, for he wants to enter the 
highest spiritual planet, namely Kṛṣṇaloka, Goloka Vṛndāvana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore  he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-
bhaktaḥ,  he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of 
devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with 
Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional 
processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.  
The term  saṅg a-varjitaḥ  is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons 
who are against Kṛṣṇa. Not only are the atheistic persons against Kṛṣṇa, but so also are 
those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure 
form of devotional service is described in Bhakti- rasāmṛta -sindhu  (1.1.11) as follows:  
anyābhilāṣitā -śūnyaṁ  
jñāna -karmādy -anāvṛtam  
ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-  
śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā  
In this verse Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī clearly states that if anyone wants to execute un alloyed 
devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be 
freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of 
material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, that is called pure 
devotional service.  Ānukūlyasya saṅkalpaḥ prātikūlyasya varjanam (Hari -bhakti-
vilāsa  11.676). One should think of Kṛṣṇa and act for Kṛṣṇa favorably, not unf avorably. 
Kaṁsa was an enemy of Kṛṣṇa’s. From the very beginning of Kṛṣṇa’s birth, Kaṁsa 
planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was 
always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was 
always Kṛṣṇa conscious in every respect, but that Kṛṣṇa consciousness was not favorable, 
and therefore in spite of his always thinking of Kṛṣṇa twenty- four hours a day, he was 
considered a demon, and Kṛṣṇa at last killed him. Of course anyone who is kil led by 
Kṛṣṇa attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the 
highest planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana. His only objective is to serve Kṛṣṇa wherever he may 
be. 
A devotee of Kṛṣṇa is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy 
(nirvairaḥ ). How is this? A devotee situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness knows that only 
devotional service to Kṛṣṇa can relieve a person from all the p roblems of life. He has 
personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the 
Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consci ousness. The favorite example 
is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are man y examples, such as Ṭhākura Haridāsa and 
Prahlāda Mahārāja. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and it is difficult. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relat ionship with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, the highest benefit one 
can render to human society is relieving one’s neighbor from all material problems. In 
such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine 
how merciful Kṛṣṇa is to tho se engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. 
Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the 
body.  
In summary, the universal form of Kṛṣṇa, which is a temporary manifestation, and the 
form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Viṣṇu, four -handed, have all 
been exhibited by Kṛṣṇa. Thus Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that 
Kṛṣṇa is a manifestation of the original  viśva -rūpa,  or Viṣṇu. Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all 
forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Viṣṇus, but for a devotee no form of Kṛṣṇa is 
important but the original form, two -handed Śyāmasundara. In the  Brahma -saṁhitā  it is 
stated that those who are attached to the Śyāmasundara form of Kṛṣṇa in love and 
devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should 
understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of Kṛṣṇa is 
essential and supreme.  
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the  Śrīmad Bhagavad -
gītā in the matter of the Universal Form.

Translation 
For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the 
Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is 
always difficult for those who are embodied.  
Purport  
The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lo rd are called  jñāna- yogīs,  and persons who are in 
full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-
yogīs.  Now, here the difference between  jñāna- yoga  and bhakti- yoga  is definitely 
expressed. The process of  jñāna -yoga,  although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, 
is very troublesome, whereas the path of  bhakti -yoga,  the process of being in direct 
service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is em bodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him to 
simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the  bhakti- yogī accepts 
the Deity of Kṛṣṇa as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the 
mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic 
literature that worship may be  saguṇa  or nirguṇa  – of the Supreme possessing or not 
possessing attr ibutes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is  saguṇa  worship, for the Lord 
is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the 
absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.  
A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we 
post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty. 
But any old box, or an imitation which we may find somewhere but which is not 
authorized by the post office, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized 
representation in the Deity form, which is called  arcā- vigraha.  This arcā-vigraha is an 
incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will a ccept service through that form. The Lord is 
omnipotent, all -powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as  arcā-vigraha  He can accept the 
services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life.  
So for a devotee there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization the 
path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme 
through such Vedic literature s as the  Upaniṣads,  and they have to learn the language, 
understand the nonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very 
easy for a common man. A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaged in devotional service, 
simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative 
obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating 
the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead very eas ily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a 
troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personali ty 
directly. A similar passage appears in  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam.  It is stated there that if one 
ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called  bhakti),  but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and 
what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply 
troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path 
of self- realization , because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.  
A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such 
a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of  jñāna -yoga,  may come to the point 
of bhakti -yoga,  or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also 
beco mes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied 
soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time 
of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and one should know for certain 
that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual, blissful self. One 
should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one 
wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus the 
process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expr essed in this verse, should never be encouraged at 
any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by Lord Kṛṣṇa.

Purport  
One wh o is engaged in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s devotional service lives in a direct relationship with 
the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is transcendental from the very 
beginning. A devotee does not live on the material plane –  he lives in Kṛṣṇa. The holy 
name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa and His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he 
offers Kṛṣṇa food, Kṛṣṇa directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becom es Kṛṣṇa -
ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand 
how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the  Bhagavad -gītā and in other 
Vedic literatures.

Translation 
My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without 
deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti -yoga. In this way develop a 
desire to  attain Me.  
Purport  
In this verse, two different processes of  bhakti- yoga  are indicated. The first applies to one 
who has actually developed an attachment for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who h as not developed an 
attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For this second class there are 
different prescribed rules and regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the 
stage of attachment to Kṛṣṇa.  
Bhakti- yoga  is the purifi cation of the senses. At the present moment in material existence 
the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification. But by the practice of bhakti -yoga  these senses can become purified, and in the purified state they come 
directly in conta ct with the Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in 
some service to some master, but I don’t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to 
get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays 
me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure 
stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service, 
performed with the present senses.  
This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone’s heart. And, there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material association. Now the heart 
has to be purified of the material association, and that dormant, natural love for Kṛṣṇa has 
to be revived. That is the  whole process.  
To practice the regulative principles of  bhakti- yoga  one should, under the guidance of an 
expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should rise early in the morning, take 
bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and chant Hare  Kṛṣṇa, then collect flowers to offer 
to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take  prasādam,  and so on. There are 
various rules and regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear Bhagavad- gītā and Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  from pure devotees. This practice can help 
anyone rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual 
kingdom of God. This practice of  bhakti -yoga,  under the rules and regulations, with the 
direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one to the stage of love of God.

Translation 
If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti -yoga, then just try to work for Me, 
because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage.  
Purport  
One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of  bhakti -yoga,  under the 
guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this perf ectional stage by working for 
the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has already been explained in the fifty- fifth verse 
of the Eleventh Chapter. One should be sympathetic to the propagation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There are many devotees who are engaged in  the propagation of Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the 
regulative principles of  bhakti- yoga,  he can try to help such work. Every endeavor 
requires land, capital, organization and labor. Just as in busin ess one requires a place to 
stay, some capital to use, some labor and some organization to expand, so the same is 
required in the service of Kṛṣṇa. The only difference is that in materialism one works for 
sense gratification. The same work, however, can be  performed for the satisfaction of 
Kṛṣṇa, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an 
office or temple for propagating Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. 
There are various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one 
cannot sacrifice the results of his activities, the same person can still sacrifice some 
percentage to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This voluntary service to the cause of Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness will he lp one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one 
becomes perfect.

Translation 
It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by 
birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed- giving father.  
Purport  
In this verse it is clearly explained that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the original father of all living entities. The living entities are combinations of the material 
nature and the spiritual nature. Such living e ntities are seen not only on this planet but on 
every planet, even on the highest, where Brahmā is situated. Everywhere there are living 
entities; within the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and Kṛṣṇa’s seed -giving process. 
The purport is that the material world is impregnated with living entities, who come out in various forms at the time of creation according to their past deeds.

Translation 
One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once 
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.  
Purport  
This verse is a reply to Arjuna’s third question: What is the m eans of attaining to the 
transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell 
of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes 
of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his 
consciousness to Kṛṣṇa activities. Kṛṣṇa activities are known as  bhakti -yoga  – always 
acting for Kṛṣṇa. This includes not only Kṛṣṇa, but His different plenary expansions such 
as Rāma and Nārāyaṇa. He has innumerab le expansions. One who is engaged in the 
service of any of the forms of Kṛṣṇa, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be 
transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of Kṛṣṇa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowled ge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are 
omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of Kṛṣṇa or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of ma terial nature are very difficult to overcome, one 
can overcome them easily. This has already been explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire equality 
with Kṛṣṇa. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and 
the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold 
mine. Thus the living entity, in his spiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as Kṛṣṇa 
in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question 
of bhakti -yoga. Bhakti- yoga  means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there, and the 
activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the 
individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be no meaning to bhakti- yoga . If one is not 
situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme 
Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It  is said in 
the Vedic literature,  brahmaiva san brahmāpy eti . One can attain the Supreme Brahman 
by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. 
By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity a s an individual 
soul.

Translation 
And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is immortal, imperishable and 
eternal and is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness.  
Purport  
The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity and happi ness. 
Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Paramātmā, the Supersoul, is the 
middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Paramātmā and 
the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh 
Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme 
Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with fragme nts of the superior 
nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity 
conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he 
elevates himself from the position of material existence and grad ually rises up to the 
Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is 
the first stage in self -realization. At this stage the Brahman -realized person is 
transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then 
gradually rise up to Paramātmā realization and then to the realization of the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic lit erature. The four 
Kumāras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they 
gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself 
beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of fal ling down. In Śrīmad -
Bhāgavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal 
Brahman, without going further, with no information of the Supreme Person, his 
intelligence is not pe rfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman 
platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional 
service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said,  raso vai saḥ, rasaṁ hy evāyaṁ 
labdhvānandī bhavati:  “When one understands the Personality of Godhead, the reservoir 
of pleasure, Kṛṣṇa, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.” ( Taittirīya 
Upaniṣad 2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee 
approaches Him there is an  exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king 
enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so eternal happiness, imperishable 
happiness, and eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of 
Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional service. This is already 
possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.  
The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material 
world, and due to this he falls down. In  his constitutional position, a living entity is above 
the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in 
the different modes of material nature –  goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the 
association of these three  modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By 
engagement in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is 
removed. Therefore  the process of devotional service, beginning with hearing, chanting, 
remembering – the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service –  should be 
practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence 
of the s piritual master, one’s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes 
firmly situated in the Lord’s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from 
the twenty -second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord i s very 
simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of 
foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see 
the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities 
of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental 
vibration Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, 
Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorat ing the appearances 
and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one 
becomes completely detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate 
himself in the  brahma -jyotir  or the different varieties of the Brahman c onception is equal 
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.  
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the  Śrīmad Bhagavad -
gītā in the matter of the Three Modes of Material Nature.

Translation 
Those who are free from false prestige, illusion and false association, who understand 
the eternal, who are done with material lust, who are freed from the dualities of 
happiness and distress, and who, unbewildered, know how to surrender unto the 
Supreme Person attain to that eternal kingdom.  
Purport  
The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification is that one 
should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is p uffed up, thinking 
himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the 
Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge 
that he is not lord of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. 
When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. 
For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to 
surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusio n, for although one comes here, 
stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of 
the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole 
world moves under this impression. People ar e considering the land, this earth, to belong 
to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are 
the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor 
of this world. When one is  freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the 
false associations caused by familial, social and national affections. These faulty 
associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual 
knowledge. One ha s to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is 
actually not his own. And when one has an understanding of things as they are, he 
becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. 
He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead.

Translation 
That supreme abode of Mine is  not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or 
electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.  
Purport  
The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa – which is 
known as Kṛṣṇaloka, Goloka Vṛndāvana – is described here. In the spiritual sky there is no 
need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity, because all the planets are self -luminous. 
We have only one planet in this universe, the sun, which is self -luminous, but all the 
planets in the spiritual sk y are self -luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets 
(called Vaikuṇṭhas) constitutes the shining sky known as the  brahma -jyotir.  Actually, the 
effulgence is emanating from the planet of Kṛṣṇa, Goloka Vṛndāvana. Part of that shining 
effulgence i s covered by the  mahat- tattva,  the material world. Other than this, the major 
portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called Vaikuṇṭhas, chief of 
which is Goloka Vṛndāvana.  
As long as a living entity is in this dark material wor ld, he is in conditional life, but as 
soon as he reaches the spiritual sky by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no chance of his coming back here. In 
his conditional life, the living entit y considers himself to be the lord of this material world, 
but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.  
One should be captivat ed by this information. He should desire to transfer himself to that 
eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment, but if he 
takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has 
to associate himself with devotees, those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One should 
search out a society dedicated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and learn how to discharge 
devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One 
cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing 
himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lor d. 
Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree. In 
Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material  nature is 
described. Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental.  
The words  paramaṁ mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner is the 
property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is  paramam,  full of six opulenc es. 
The Kaṭha Upaniṣad (2.2.15) also confirms that in the spiritual world there is no need of 
sunshine, moonshine or stars ( na tatra sūryo bhāti na candra- tārakam ), for the whole 
spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. Tha t supreme 
abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no other means.

Translation 
The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragment al parts. Due to 
conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the 
mind.  
Purport  
In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord –  eternally. It is not that he assumes 
individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the 
Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said,  sanātanaḥ.  According to the 
Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable 
expansions, of which the primary expansions are called  viṣṇu -tattva  and the secondary 
expansions are called the living entities. In other words, the  viṣṇu -tattva  is the personal 
expansion, and the living entities are the separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord Rāma, Nṛsiṁha -deva, Viṣṇumūrti and all the 
predominating Deities in the Vaikuṇṭha planets. The separated expansions, the living 
entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the 
separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and 
parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His 
qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his 
personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that 
independence one becomes a con ditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is 
always liberated. In either case, he is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the 
material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As 
a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world.  
The liv ing entities, not only human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater 
controllers of the material world – Brahmā, Lord Śiva and even Viṣṇu – are all parts and 
parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The 
word karṣati  (“struggling” or “grappling hard”) is very significant. The conditioned soul is 
bound up, as though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the 
mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. When t he mind is 
in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, 
his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels 
in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this vers e, that the conditioned soul is 
covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this 
material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity. 
The following information is there in the  Mādhyandināyana- śruti: sa vā eṣa brahma -
niṣṭha idaṁ śarīraṁ martyam atisṛjya brahmābhisampadya brahmaṇā paśyati brahmaṇā 
śṛṇoti brahmaṇaivedaṁ sarvam anubhavati.  It is stated here that when a living entity 
gives up this material embodiment and enters i nto the spiritual world, he revives his 
spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the 
Supreme Personality as He is. From  smṛti  also it is understood,  vasanti yatra puruṣāḥ 
sarve vaikuṇṭha -mūrtayaḥ:  in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part -and-parcel living entities and the expansions of  viṣṇu -
mūrti.  In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  
The words  mamaivāṁśaḥ  (“fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord”) are also 
very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material 
broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be 
cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not li ke matter, which can 
be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here, 
because the Sanskrit word sanātana (“eternal”) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. 
It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter t hat in each and every individual 
body the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present ( dehino ’smin yathā dehe ). 
That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original 
spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiri tual planet and enjoys association with the 
Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental 
part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one with the Lord, just as the parts

Translation 
I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and 
forgetfulness. By all the Vedas, I am to be known. Indeed,  I am the compiler of 
Vedānta, and I am the knower of the Vedas. 
Purport  
The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramātmā in everyone’s heart, and it is from Him that 
all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of his past life, but he has to 
act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work. 
Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied 
to him, and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past li fe. Thus, 
the Lord is not only all -pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He 
awards the different fruitive results. He is worshipable not only as the impersonal Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the localized Paramātmā, bu t as the 
form of the incarnation of the  Vedas  as well. The  Vedas  give the right direction to people 
so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back to home. The Vedas  offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, a nd Kṛṣṇa in 
His incarnation as Vyāsadeva is the compiler of the  Vedānta- sūtra.  The commentation on 
the Vedānta -sūtra  by Vyāsadeva in the  Śrīmad -Bhāgavatam  gives the real understanding 
of Vedānta- sūtra.  The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned 
soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, and the giver of knowledge in the form of the  Vedas  and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī 
Kṛṣṇa, t he teacher of the  Bhagavad -gītā. He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus 
God is all -good; God is all- merciful.  
Antaḥ -praviṣṭaḥ śāstā janānām.  The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his prese nt 
body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord. Although he forgets, 
the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not 
only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the 
Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand 
the Vedas  from Him. If one is serious about understanding the Vedic knowledge, then 
Kṛṣṇa gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for 
understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand Kṛṣṇa. Vedic 
literature confirms this:  yo ’sau sarvair vedair gīyate.  In all Vedic literature, beginning 
from the four  Vedas, Vedānta- sūtra  and the  Upaniṣads  and Purāṇas,  the glories of the 
Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performance of Vedic rituals, discussion of the Vedic philosophy and worship of the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the 
purpose of the  Vedas  is to understand Kṛṣṇa. The  Vedas  give us direction by which to 
understand Kṛṣṇa and the process of realizing Him. The ultimate goal is the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead.  Vedānta- sūtra  (1.1.4) confirms this in the following words:  tat tu 
samanvayāt.  One can attain perfection in three stages . By understanding Vedic literature 
one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by 
performing the different processes one can approach Him, and at the end one can attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Pe rsonality of Godhead. In this verse 
the purpose of the  Vedas,  the understanding of the  Vedas,  and the goal of the  Vedas  are 
clearly defined.

Translation 
Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is the 
knower of everything. He therefore engages himself in full devotional service to Me, 
O son of Bharata.  
Purport  
There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional  position of the living 
entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord Kṛṣṇa to be the Supreme Person is 
actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes  on simply speculating 
about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, 
engages directly in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. 
Throughout the whole of  Bhagavad -gītā, this fact is being stressed at every step. And still 
there are so many stubborn commentators on  Bhagavad- gītā who consider the Supreme 
Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.  
Vedic knowledge is called  śruti,  learning by aural reception. One should actually receive 
the Vedic message from authorities like Kṛṣṇa and His representatives. Here Kṛṣṇa 
distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from t his source. Simply to hear 
like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear 
from  Bhagavad- gītā that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, knows the purpose of the  Vedas;  no one else knows 
the p urpose of the  Vedas.  
The word bhajati  is very significant. In many places the word bhajati is expressed in 
relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full Kṛṣṇa 
consciousness, in the devotional service of the Lord, it is t o be understood that he has 
understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vaiṣṇava  paramparā it is said that if one is 
engaged in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa, then there is no need for any other spiritual process for understanding the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the point, 
because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary 
processes of understanding. But if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of 
lives, does not come to the point that  Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and 
that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless 
waste of time.

disposed;  sarveṣu  — to all;  bhūteṣu — living entities;  mat-bhaktim  — My devotional

Translation 
One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman 
and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally 
disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service 
unto Me.  
Purport  
To the impersonalist, achieving the  brahma -bhūta stage, becoming one with the Absolute, 
is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to go still further, to 
become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that one who is engaged in pure 
devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called  brahma -
bhūta,  oneness with the Absolute. Without being one with the S upreme, the Absolute, one 
cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference between 
the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.  
In the material concept of life, when one works for  sense gratification, there is misery, but 
in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. 
The devotee in Kṛṣṇa consciousness has nothing for which to lament or desire. Since God 
is full, a living entity who is en gaged in God’s service, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, becomes 
also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure 
devotee has no thought other than Kṛṣṇa, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament 
for any material lo ss or aspire for gain, because he is full in the service of the Lord. He has 
no desire for material enjoyment, because he knows that every living entity is a fragmental 
part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see,  in 
the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions 
are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or 
disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the  brahma-
bhūta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of 
existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one’s 
individuality becomes hellish, the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmag oria, and the senses are like serpents whose poison teeth are broken. As there 
is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, there is no fear from the senses when they are 
automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, bu t for 
a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaikuṇṭha, or the spiritual sky. The highest 
personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee. Such 
a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pur e devotional 
service in this age.

Translation 
One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by 
devotional service. And when one is  in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he 
can enter into the kingdom of God.  
 
Purport  
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, and His plenary portions cannot be 
understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If anyone wants to understa nd 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional service under the 
guidance of a pure devotee. Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead 
will always be hidden. As already stated in  Bhagavad -gītā (7.25) , nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ 
sarvasya:  He is not revealed to everyone. No one can understand God simply by erudite 
scholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional servi ce can understand what Kṛṣṇa is. University degrees 
are not helpful.  
One who is fully conversant with the Kṛṣṇa science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Kṛṣṇa. Becoming Brahman does not mean that one loses 
his identity. De votional service is there, and as long as devotional service exists, there 
must be God, the devotee, and the process of devotional service. Such knowledge is never 
vanquished, even after liberation. Liberation involves getting free from the concept of 
mate rial life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, 
but in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One should not mistakenly think that the 
word  viśate,  “enters into Me,” supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous 
with the impersonal Brahman. No.  Viśate  means that one can enter into the abode of the 
Supreme Lord in one’s individuality to engage in His association and render service unto 
Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tre e but to 
enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing 
into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but 
the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in  the ocean. We find so 
many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean 
is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean 
depths.  
Because of his pure devotional service, a devot ee can understand the transcendental 
qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it is stated in the Eleventh 
Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand. The same is confirmed here; one 
can understand the Supreme Personality of  Godhead by devotional service and enter into 
His kingdom.  
After attainment of the  brahma- bhūta  stage of freedom from material conceptions, 
devotional service begins by one’s hearing about the Lord. When one hears about the 
Supreme Lord, automatically the  brahma -bhūta stage develops, and material 
contamination – greediness and lust for sense enjoyment –  disappears. As lust and desires 
disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he become s free from material contamination. In that state 
of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of  Śrīmad -
Bhāgavatam also. After liberation the process of  bhakti,  or transcendental serv ice, 
continues. The  Vedānta -sūtra  (4.1.12) confirms this:  ā-prāyaṇāt tatrāpi hi dṛṣṭam.  This 
means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues. In the  Śrīmad -
Bhāgavatam,  real devotion al liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity 
in his own identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already 
explained: every living entity is a part -and-parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord. 
Ther efore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service is never 
stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life.

Translation 
If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life 
by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through 
false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.  
Purport  
A person in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not unduly anxious about executing the duties of his existence. The foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all anxiety. For one 
who acts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Lord Kṛṣṇa becomes the most intimate friend. He 
always looks after His friend’s comfort, and He gives Himself to His friend, who is  so 
devotedly engaged working twenty -four hours a day to please the Lord. Therefore, no one 
should be carried away by the false ego of the bodily concept of life. One should not 
falsely think himself independent of the laws of material nature or free to ac t. He is 
already under strict material laws. But as soon as he acts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is 
liberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully that one who 
is not active in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is losing himself in the mate rial whirlpool, in the 
ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what 
is not to be done, but a person who acts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is free to act because 
everything is prompted by Kṛṣṇa from within and confirmed by the spiritual master.

Translation 
The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the 
wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the 
material energy.  
Purport  
Arjuna wa s not the supreme knower, and his decision to fight or not to fight was confined 
to his limited discretion. Lord Kṛṣṇa instructed that the individual is not all in all. The 
Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, Kṛṣṇa, as the localized Supersoul, s its in 
the heart directing the living being. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past 
deeds, but the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness 
of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of livin g entities are directed by this 
Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body, 
which is created in the material energy under the direction of the Supersoul. As soon as a 
living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that 
bodily situation. A person seated in a high- speed motorcar goes faster than one seated in a 
slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order 
of the Supreme Soul, m aterial nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type 
of living entity so that he may work according to his past desires. The living entity is not 
independent. One should not think himself independent of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead.  The individual is always under the Lord’s control. Therefore one’s duty is to 
surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse.

Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My 
very dear friend.  
 
Purport  
The most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee of 
Kṛṣṇa and always think of Him and act for Him. One should not become an official 
meditator. Life should be so molded that one will always have the chance to think of 
Kṛṣṇa. One should always act in such a way that all his daily activities are in connection 
with Kṛṣṇa. He should arrange his life in such a way that throughout the twenty -four hours 
he cannot but think of Kṛṣṇa. And the Lord’s promise is that anyone who is in such pure 
Kṛṣṇa consciousness will certainly return to the abode of Kṛṣṇa, where he will be engaged 
in the association of Kṛṣṇa f ace to face. This most confidential part of knowledge is 
spoken to Arjuna because he is the dear friend of Kṛṣṇa. Everyone who follows the path of 
Arjuna can become a dear friend to Kṛṣṇa and obtain the same perfection as Arjuna.  
These words stress that on e should concentrate his mind upon Kṛṣṇa – the very form with 
two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a beautiful face and peacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of Kṛṣṇa found in the  Brahma -saṁhitā and other literatures. 
One should f ix his mind on this original form of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. One should not even 
divert his attention to other forms of the Lord. The Lord has multiforms as Viṣṇu, 
Nārāyaṇa, Rāma, Varāha, etc., but a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that 
was present  before Arjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of Kṛṣṇa constitutes the 
most confidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna is the 
most dear friend of Kṛṣṇa’s.

you; sarva  — all; pāpebhyaḥ  — from sinful reactions;  mokṣayiṣyāmi  — will

Translation 
Abandon all varieties of r eligion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from 
all sinful reactions. Do not fear.  
Purport  
The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge and processes of religion – knowledge 
of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of  the different types of 
orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of 
nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing Bhagavad -gītā, the Lord says that Arjuna 
should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply 
surrender to Kṛṣṇa. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions,  for the 
Lord personally promises to protect him.  
In the Seventh Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful 
reactions can take to the worship of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Thus one may think that unless he is free 
from all sinful reactions he c annot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is 
here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of 
surrendering to Śrī Kṛṣṇa he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to 
free onesel f from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept Kṛṣṇa as the supreme 
savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.  
The process of surrender to Kṛṣṇa is described in the  Hari -bhakti- vilāsa  (11.676):  
ānukūlyasya saṅkalpaḥ 
prātikūlyasya varjanam  
rakṣiṣyatīti viśvāso  
goptṛtve varaṇaṁ tathā  
ātma -nikṣepa -kārpaṇye  
ṣaḍ-vidhā śaraṇāgatiḥ  
According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional se rvice of the Lord. One may perform a 
particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by 
executing his duty one does not come to the point of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all his activities 
are in vain. Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness 
should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances Kṛṣṇa will protect 
him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and 
soul together. Kṛṣṇa will see  to that. One should always think himself helpless and should 
consider Kṛṣṇa the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages 
himself in devotional service to the Lord in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion 
and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the 
mystic  yoga  system, etc., but one who surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa does not have to execute so 
many methods. That  simple surrender unto Kṛṣṇa will save him from unnecessarily 
wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful 
reactions.  
One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of Kṛṣṇa. His name is Kṛṣṇa because He is 
all-attract ive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all -powerful, omnipotent vision 
of Kṛṣṇa is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists – some of them are 
attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersou l 
feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as 
Kṛṣṇa Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, dev otional service to 
Kṛṣṇa, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the 
essence of the whole  Bhagavad -gītā. Karma -yogīs,  empiric philosophers, mystics and 
devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. 
The particular words used here,  mā śucaḥ,  “Don’t fear, don’t hesitate, don’t worry,” are 
very significant. One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religiou s 
forms and simply surrender unto Kṛṣṇa, but such worry is useless.

Translation 
For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is 
guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.  
Purport  
Generally it is advised that  Bhagavad- gītā be discussed amongst the devotees only, for 
those who are not dev otees will understand neither Kṛṣṇa nor  Bhagavad- gītā. Those who 
do not accept Kṛṣṇa as He is and  Bhagavad -gītā as it is should not try to 
explain  Bhagavad -gītā whimsically and become offenders.  Bhagavad -gītā should be 
explained to persons who are ready to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead.  It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. 
Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present  Bhagavad -gītā as it is will advance in 
devotional activities and reach t he pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure 
devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead.

Translation 
Wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the 
supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, 
and morality. That is my opinion.  
Purport  
The Bhagavad -gītā began with an inquiry of Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s. He was hopeful of the victory 
of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhīṣma, Droṇa and Karṇa. He was hopeful that 
the victory would be on his side. But after describing the s cene on the battlefield, Sañjaya 
told the King, “You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.” He directly confirmed that Dhṛtarāṣṭra 
could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because 
Kṛṣṇa was there. Kṛṣṇa’s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition 
of another opulence. Kṛṣṇa is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There 
are many instances of such ren unciation, for Kṛṣṇa is also the master of renunciation.  
The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira. Arjuna was fighting on 
behalf of his elder brother, Yudhiṣṭhira. Because Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were on the side of 
Yudhiṣṭhira, Yudhiṣṭhira’s vic tory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule 
the world, and Sañjaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhiṣṭhira. It is 
also predicted here that Yudhiṣṭhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish 
more and more be cause not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict 
moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.  
There are many less intelligent persons who take  Bhagavad -gītā to be a discussion of 
topic s between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some 
may protest that Kṛṣṇa incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated:  Bhagav ad-gītā is the supreme instruction in morality. The 
supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty -fourth 
verse:  man- manā bhava mad -bhaktaḥ.  One must become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and the 
essence of all religion is to surrender  unto Kṛṣṇa ( sarva -dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ 
śaraṇaṁ vraja). The instructions of  Bhagavad -gītā constitute the supreme process of 
religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lea d to this 
process, but the last instruction of the  Gītā is the last word in all morality and religion: 
surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.  
From  Bhagavad -gītā we can underst and that to realize oneself by philosophical 
speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto Kṛṣṇa is the 
highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of  Bhagavad- gītā. The path of 
regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of 
religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of know ledge are still more 
confidential. And surrender unto Kṛṣṇa in devotional service in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness 
is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.  
Another feature of  Bhagavad -gītā is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features – impersonal Brahman, 
localized Paramātmā, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Perfect 
know ledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. If one understands 
Kṛṣṇa, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. 
Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The  
living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally 
conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are 
considered fundamental parts of Kṛṣṇa. Material energy is manifested into twenty -four 
divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and 
invisible.  
In Bhagavad -gītā five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of 
activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. All 
conceptions of the Absolute Truth –  impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and any 
other transcendental conception – exist within the category of understanding the Supreme 
Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the 
living enti ty, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the 
Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya’s 
philosophy is that of “inconceivable oneness and difference.” This system of philosophy 
constit utes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.  
The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of 
the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa may be compared to the sun, and the living entities 
to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of Kṛṣṇa, they have a 
tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In 
other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs  to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By 
proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Kṛṣṇa. Thus he attains 
his normal condition in the pleasure -giving potency.  
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the  Śrīmad Bhagavad -
gītā in the matter of its Conclusion –  the Perfection of Renunciation.
