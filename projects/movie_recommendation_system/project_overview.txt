Project Overview:
Build a simple movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences. You'll use a dataset of movies, and the project will allow you to explore various techniques for filtering and recommending movies. You can personalize the system by adding features like genre preferences, user ratings, and even sentiment analysis of user reviews.

Steps to Get Started:

Set Up the Project:

Create a new Python project and set up a virtual environment.
Install necessary libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy.
Dataset Collection:

You can use a movie dataset like the MovieLens dataset which contains information about movies, genres, and user ratings.
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset using pandas.
Clean the data by handling missing values, normalizing ratings, and converting genres into a more usable format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of movie ratings.
Analyze popular genres and trends over time.
Building the Recommendation Engine:

Option 1: Collaborative Filtering: Use user-based or item-based collaborative filtering to recommend movies based on user similarities or movie similarities.
Option 2: Content-Based Filtering: Recommend movies based on the content features like genre, director, or actors.
Option 3: Hybrid Approach: Combine both collaborative and content-based filtering for better recommendations.
Personalization:

Allow users to input their preferences (e.g., favorite genres or actors).
Implement a simple UI using a library like streamlit or flask to interact with the recommendation system.
Enhancements:

Add sentiment analysis to analyze user reviews and incorporate this into the recommendation process.
Integrate an API to fetch the latest movie data.
Add a feature to save user preferences and viewing history.
Testing and Optimization:

Test your recommendation system with different user profiles.
Fine-tune your recommendation algorithm to improve accuracy.
Deployment (Optional):

Deploy your recommendation system on a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS so others can use it.
