Project: Daily Journal Application with Sentiment Analysis

Project Outline

1. Log Daily Entries: Allow the user to write a journal entry for each day, saving it with the date.
2. Data Storage: Save entries in a CSV file or SQLite database, including fields for date and content.
3. Sentiment Analysis:
    a. Use TextBlob or NLTK to analyze the sentiment of each entry (positive, neutral, negative).
    b. Store the sentiment score alongside each entry for future analysis.
4. Search and Filter:
    a. Implement search functionality to filter entries by keywords or by sentiment (e.g., only positive entries).
5. Visualize Mood Over Time: Create graphs to visualize changes in mood over weeks or months.
6. Advanced (Optional):
    a. Add a word cloud feature to display commonly used words.
    b. Implement password protection for privacy.

Requirements
Python libraries: pandas, TextBlob (or NLTK), matplotlib, and optionally wordcloud.
