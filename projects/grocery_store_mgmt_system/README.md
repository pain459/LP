# **Project Plan: Grocery Store Management System**

---

## **Objective**
Develop a fully functional Grocery Store Management System with features for SKU management, barcode generation, billing, and sales reporting, with potential for future enhancements.

---

## **Milestones and Tasks**

### **1. SKU Database**
**Objective:** Create and manage a database of items with their details (e.g., SKU ID, name, price, category, etc.).

- **Tasks:**
  - Design the database schema:
    - Fields: `SKU_ID`, `Item_Name`, `Category`, `Price`, `Stock_Quantity`, `Description`.
  - Implement basic CRUD operations:
    - **Add Item:** Allow entry of new items into the database.
    - **Delete Item:** Remove items using their `SKU_ID`.
    - **Update Item:** Modify item details like price or stock.
    - **Retrieve Items:** Fetch and display item details.
  - Validate inputs to ensure clean and accurate data.
  - Decide on the storage mechanism:
    - SQLite or PostgreSQL/MySQL for scalability.

- **Tools/Technologies:** Python (SQLAlchemy/SQLite library), Flask/Django for API, database systems.

---

### **2. Barcode Generator**
**Objective:** Generate unique barcodes for each SKU and save them as images/files for printing.

- **Tasks:**
  - Select a barcode format (e.g., Code-128, Code-39, QR Code).
  - Integrate a library like `python-barcode` or `qrcode` to generate barcodes.
  - Store barcodes in a designated directory with file names corresponding to `SKU_ID`.
  - Provide an option to print barcodes via a user interface.

- **Tools/Technologies:** `python-barcode`, `qrcode`, PIL (Python Imaging Library).

---

### **3. Billing Counter**
**Objective:** Automate billing by scanning barcodes, calculating totals, and printing receipts.

- **Tasks:**
  - Design a barcode scanner interface:
    - Simulate barcode scanning with a manual input field for the `SKU_ID`.
  - Fetch item details from the SKU database using scanned `SKU_ID`.
  - Calculate the bill:
    - Apply tax rates and discounts if applicable.
  - Generate and print the bill:
    - Receipt layout: Item name, quantity, price, subtotal, total.
    - Option for printing receipts.
  - Update stock quantities in the SKU database.

- **Tools/Technologies:** Python, Flask/Django for API, `reportlab` or `weasyprint` for receipt generation.

---

### **4. Sales Report Generator**
**Objective:** Generate daily, weekly, and monthly sales reports for analysis.

- **Tasks:**
  - Define the report format:
    - Include total sales, best-selling items, low-stock items, and revenue by category.
  - Query the SKU database for sales data.
  - Export reports to CSV/Excel and optionally PDF.
  - Provide a dashboard interface to select timeframes and view reports.

- **Tools/Technologies:** Pandas, Matplotlib/Plotly for visualizations, Flask/Django for API.

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Initialization and Planning**
- Set up the project repository (GitHub/GitLab).
- Define a modular structure for the project:
  - `/database`: Scripts and schema for SKU database.
  - `/barcode_generator`: Code for barcode generation.
  - `/billing`: Scripts for billing counter operations.
  - `/reports`: Scripts for report generation.
  - `/static`: Assets like barcodes and receipts.
- Create a basic Dockerfile for the application.

---

### **Phase 2: Development**
1. Implement the SKU database module with CRUD operations.
2. Develop the barcode generation module.
3. Build the billing counter with receipt generation.
4. Implement the sales report generator.

---

### **Phase 3: Testing and Debugging**
- Unit test each module for functionality and reliability.
- End-to-end testing of workflow:
  1. Add an item to the SKU database.
  2. Generate its barcode.
  3. Simulate barcode scanning at the billing counter.
  4. Generate sales reports based on transactions.

---

### **Phase 4: Deployment**
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Test deployment on local/remote servers.
- Provide clear documentation for each component.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Inventory Management:** Automatic low-stock alerts and order placement.
- **Customer Loyalty Program:** Track customer purchases and offer discounts.
- **Payment Integration:** Add card or online payment support.
- **Mobile App:** Develop a companion app for the system.
