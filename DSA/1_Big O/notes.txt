only 3 cases in the program

omega   -  Ω
theta   -  θ
omicron -  Ο

best case is omega, mid case is theta and worst case is Omicron.

In terms of Big O, its always the worst case only.

O(n) -- always a proportioanal graph

if a job take n time and 2 iterations take 2n times, the complexity shouldn't be O(2n), instead it is O(n)
This rule is called as dropping the constants.
